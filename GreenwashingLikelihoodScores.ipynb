Siemens Energy Canada won the order with a design that would use power from provincial government-owned BC hydro dams to run all Woodfibre gas refrigeration to ship cargoes of up to 2.1 million metric tons/year, or 275 MMcf/d. The terminal \\u201c will become the world\\u2019 s lowest-emission LNG export facility, \\u201d according to Woodfibre LNG President Christine Kennedy. She indicated the C $ 1.6 billion ( $ 1.3 billion) Woodfibre export project is on track to hit a revised 2027 target for starting overseas deliveries. [ Decision Maker: A real-time news service focused on the North American natural gas and LNG markets, NGI\\u2019 s All News Access is the industry\\u2019 s go-to resource for need-to-know information. Learn more. ] The BC project supports \\u201c global decarbonization with exports to Asian economies currently driven by coal, \\u201d added Siemens Vice President Thorbj\\u00f6rn Fors. The firms estimated that the all-electric export terminal design would achieve greenhouse gas ( GHG) emissions reductions exceeding 80%, compared to projects that burn fossil fuel to run LNG refrigeration systems. Owner Woodfibre LNG Ltd., a subsidiary of Singapore-based Pacific Energy Ltd., in April told general contractor McDermott International to begin site work \\u201c required in order to move the project toward major construction commencement in 2023. \\u201d The Woodfibre-Siemens contract confirms an ongoing adaptation by energy companies to adhere to global climate change policies, as outlined in an annual global markets survey released this month by the International Gas Union ( IGU). \\u201c Importantly, the aim of decarbonization has transcended well into the liquefaction sector, \\u201d the IGU report said. \\u201c Over the past year, we have seen an increased focus on decarbonization among liquefaction facilities. \\u201d Electricity rated as zero emissions and renewable from BC Hydro dam generators figures in the jumbo LNG Canada terminal now under construction on the northern Pacific coast at Kitimat, and in the nearby native-sponsored Cedar LNG project, noted the IGU. The IGU also pointed to the recently sanctioned Plaquemines LNG and Calcasieu Pass LNG plants under development in the United States, where sponsor Venture Global LNG Inc. is working on a plan to use carbon capture and storage to dispose of an estimated 500,000 tons/year of GHG. Emissions control is becoming a market asset, according to IGU. \\u201c Low-carbon LNG is expected to play a key role in the global energy system, \\u201d the organization said. \\u201c LNG offtakers will be more cautious about the environmental and emissions performance of procured cargoes as the urgency to meet decarbonization targets intensifies. \\u201d \\u00a9 2022 Natural Gas Intelligence.

WILLINGTON \\u2014 A woman says her 80-year-old husband \\u2014 a U.S. Navy veteran who grew up in Trumbull \\u2014 is a \\u201c very lucky man \\u201d after surviving a brutal attack that police say started a college student\\u2019 s violent crime spree. Alice Franco, 71, said her husband, John, is now in stable condition. The suspect \\u2014 University of Connecticut student Peter Manfredonia \\u2014 was taken into custody Wednesday night on day six of the hunt for the 23-year-old. \\u201c I just pray this ends before anyone ( else) dies or gets hurt, \\u201d Franco said Wednesday in a phone interview with Hearst Connecticut Media before Manfredonia\\u2019 s capture that night. Connecticut state police said the series of events began Friday when Manfredonia\\u2019 s motorcycle broke down in Willington. Theodore DeMers, 62, offered Manfredonia a ride on his four-wheeler before police said he was attacked with an \\u201c edged \\u201d weapon. DeMers was killed and John Franco was critically injured when he came to help his neighbor. Alice Franco said her husband suffered several injuries to his body. \\u201c He\\u2019 s a very lucky man, \\u201d she said. \\u201c He\\u2019 s hanging in there. \\u201d She said the worst injuries are to his hands. \\u201c He\\u2019 s a very kind and gentle person... would not hurt a soul, \\u201d she said. \\u201c I\\u2019 m under the impression he had no clue what he was walking out to. \\u201d Franco credited her neighbors with saving her husband\\u2019 s life after they saw the attack and began yelling, scaring the attacker away. She said they also provided first aid for her husband\\u2019 s wounds. Doctors have told Alice Franco her husband will regain the use of his hands, but the couple will have to adjust to \\u201c a new normal. \\u201d She said she is able to speak to her husband by phone for about three minutes each day, but has not been to the hospital to visit him because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Franco said she\\u2019 s had an outpouring of offers of help from those around her. She said her husband, a Navy veteran, retired after a career in finance, has taken up hobbies amid the pandemic, including rebuilding a stone wall on their property and cleaning up a collection of tools inherited from his grandfather. \\u201c He sounds positive, \\u201d she said. \\u201c I feel happy about that. \\u201d After the attack on the two men, police said Manfredonia committed a home invasion in Willington. The resident was left unharmed Sunday after police say Manfredonia stole his guns, food, supplies and his truck. A few hours later, police recovered the stolen truck in Derby, setting off an extensive search that led authorities to a Roosevelt Drive home about a mile away. Police said video surveillance showed Manfredonia walking \\u201c directly \\u201d toward Nicholas Eisele\\u2019 s home between 5 and 6 a.m. Sunday. Eisele, who was described by police as an \\u201c acquaintance \\u201d of Manfredonia, was killed after being shot several times in the head, the state\\u2019 s medical examiner said. By the time police arrived, Manfredonia had fled and kidnapped Eisele\\u2019 s girlfriend in her 2016 Volkswagen Jetta. The woman and the car were recovered later Sunday in New Jersey. Police said the woman was unharmed and returned to Connecticut where she was interviewed by investigators. Peter Yankowski is a breaking news reporter for Hearst Connecticut Media. He previously reported for the Danbury News-Times and, before that, the Ridgefield Press.\",\n          \"AstraZeneca and Merck announced that Lynparza reduced the risk of death by 32% in patients with germline BRCA-mutated HER2-negative early breast cancer who had completed local treatment and either a neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. The news is also significant because Lynparza is the first poly-ADP ribose polymerase ( PARP) inhibitor drug to show an overall survival benefit in early breast cancer, opening up a myriad of opportunities for immuno-oncology drugs. Lynparza was tested in the OlympiA trial, an international, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial. Led by the Breast International Group and several other organizations in addition to AstraZeneca and Merck, the massive trial\\u2019 s endpoint was invasive disease-free survival. AstraZeneca and Merck presented the data at a European Society for Medical Oncology Virtual Plenary. Primary results from the trial were also published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The study showed Lynparza reduced the risk of death in breast cancer patients by 32% versus placebo. The three-year survival rate increased from 89.1% with placebo to 92.8% with Lynparza. At four years, the survival rate was 86.4% with placebo and 89.8% with the drug. Lynparza's performance in the OlympiA trial is glowing, but it\\u2019 s also not surprising, as the latest data is consistent with previous studies. The drug has proved so successful in previous trials that it is already approved in the U.S., EU and Japan to treat patients with gBRCAm, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer previously treated with chemotherapy. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Lynparza just last week as the first and only targeted adjuvant therapy with an indication specifically for patients with gBRCAm, HER2-negative high-risk early breast cancer. Safety and tolerability results were also in line with previous data. While the statistics alone are impressive, there are several other reasons the study is significant. All patients in the study had mutations in the BRCA gene, which makes breast cancer more difficult to treat. Additionally, Lynparza is the first PARP inhibitor to ever show an overall survival benefit in patients with early breast cancer. PARPs, a category of protein that helps damaged cells repair themselves, include BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are known to cause breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. When the protein mutates, it causes cancer. PARP inhibitors, including Lynparza, are immunotherapy drugs that target mutated cancer cells and trap the strands of DNA when they break apart to replicate. Lynparza may also be useful in treating other kinds of cancers caused by genetic mutations. \\u201c These exciting results further support how LYNPARZA could significantly change the way people with germline BRCA-mutated early breast cancer are treated, \\u201d said Susan Galbraith, executive vice president of oncology R & D at AstraZeneca. \\u201c The OlympiA trial is the first time we\\u2019 ve seen a PARP inhibitor deliver survival benefit in early breast cancer, highlighting the importance of persistent innovation in tackling cancer early. \\u201d OlympiA\\u2019 s study is great news for cancer patients, as well as for pharmaceutical sales. Immuno-oncology drugs are a market expected to top $ 34 billion by 2030. AstraZeneca is the world\\u2019 s top-earning company in terms of immuno-oncology drugs, with $ 13.66 billion in revenue from that category of drugs alone in 2021. Lynparza was listed as a top seller from AstraZeneca. Merck is also a leader in terms of immuno-oncology drug sales, with Lynparza standing out as one of its most profitable products.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

Siemens Energy Canada won the order with a design that would use power from provincial government-owned BC hydro dams to run all Woodfibre gas refrigeration to ship cargoes of up to 2.1 million metric tons/year, or 275 MMcf/d. The terminal \\u201c will become the world\\u2019 s lowest-emission LNG export facility, \\u201d according to Woodfibre LNG President Christine Kennedy. She indicated the C $ 1.6 billion ( $ 1.3 billion) Woodfibre export project is on track to hit a revised 2027 target for starting overseas deliveries. [ Decision Maker: A real-time news service focused on the North American natural gas and LNG markets, NGI\\u2019 s All News Access is the industry\\u2019 s go-to resource for need-to-know information. Learn more. ] The BC project supports \\u201c global decarbonization with exports to Asian economies currently driven by coal, \\u201d added Siemens Vice President Thorbj\\u00f6rn Fors. The firms estimated that the all-electric export terminal design would achieve greenhouse gas ( GHG) emissions reductions exceeding 80%, compared to projects that burn fossil fuel to run LNG refrigeration systems. Owner Woodfibre LNG Ltd., a subsidiary of Singapore-based Pacific Energy Ltd., in April told general contractor McDermott International to begin site work \\u201c required in order to move the project toward major construction commencement in 2023. \\u201d The Woodfibre-Siemens contract confirms an ongoing adaptation by energy companies to adhere to global climate change policies, as outlined in an annual global markets survey released this month by the International Gas Union ( IGU). \\u201c Importantly, the aim of decarbonization has transcended well into the liquefaction sector, \\u201d the IGU report said. \\u201c Over the past year, we have seen an increased focus on decarbonization among liquefaction facilities. \\u201d Electricity rated as zero emissions and renewable from BC Hydro dam generators figures in the jumbo LNG Canada terminal now under construction on the northern Pacific coast at Kitimat, and in the nearby native-sponsored Cedar LNG project, noted the IGU. The IGU also pointed to the recently sanctioned Plaquemines LNG and Calcasieu Pass LNG plants under development in the United States, where sponsor Venture Global LNG Inc. is working on a plan to use carbon capture and storage to dispose of an estimated 500,000 tons/year of GHG. Emissions control is becoming a market asset, according to IGU. \\u201c Low-carbon LNG is expected to play a key role in the global energy system, \\u201d the organization said. \\u201c LNG offtakers will be more cautious about the environmental and emissions performance of procured cargoes as the urgency to meet decarbonization targets intensifies. \\u201d \\u00a9 2022 Natural Gas Intelligence.

Connecticut state police said the series of events began Friday when Manfredonia\\u2019 s motorcycle broke down in Willington. Theodore DeMers, 62, offered Manfredonia a ride on his four-wheeler before police said he was attacked with an \\u201c edged \\u201d weapon. DeMers was killed and John Franco was critically injured when he came to help his neighbor. Alice Franco said her husband suffered several injuries to his body. \\u201c He\\u2019 s a very lucky man, \\u201d she said. \\u201c He\\u2019 s hanging in there. \\u201d She said the worst injuries are to his hands. \\u201c He\\u2019 s a very kind and gentle person... would not hurt a soul, \\u201d she said. \\u201c I\\u2019 m under the impression he had no clue what he was walking out to. \\u201d Franco credited her neighbors with saving her husband\\u2019 s life after they saw the attack and began yelling, scaring the attacker away. She said they also provided first aid for her husband\\u2019 s wounds. Doctors have told Alice Franco her husband will regain the use of his hands, but the couple will have to adjust to \\u201c a new normal. \\u201d She said she is able to speak to her husband by phone for about three minutes each day, but has not been to the hospital to visit him because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Franco said she\\u2019 s had an outpouring of offers of help from those around her. She said her husband, a Navy veteran, retired after a career in finance, has taken up hobbies amid the pandemic, including rebuilding a stone wall on their property and cleaning up a collection of tools inherited from his grandfather. \\u201c He sounds positive, \\u201d she said. \\u201c I feel happy about that. \\u201d After the attack on the two men, police said Manfredonia committed a home invasion in Willington. The resident was left unharmed Sunday after police say Manfredonia stole his guns, food, supplies and his truck. A few hours later, police recovered the stolen truck in Derby, setting off an extensive search that led authorities to a Roosevelt Drive home about a mile away. Police said video surveillance showed Manfredonia walking \\u201c directly \\u201d toward Nicholas Eisele\\u2019 s home between 5 and 6 a.m. Sunday. Eisele, who was described by police as an \\u201c acquaintance \\u201d of Manfredonia, was killed after being shot several times in the head, the state\\u2019 s medical examiner said. By the time police arrived, Manfredonia had fled and kidnapped Eisele\\u2019 s girlfriend in her 2016 Volkswagen Jetta. The woman and the car were recovered later Sunday in New Jersey. Police said the woman was unharmed and returned to Connecticut where she was interviewed by investigators. Peter Yankowski is a breaking news reporter for Hearst Connecticut Media.

The news is also significant because Lynparza is the first poly-ADP ribose polymerase ( PARP) inhibitor drug to show an overall survival benefit in early breast cancer, opening up a myriad of opportunities for immuno-oncology drugs. Lynparza was tested in the OlympiA trial, an international, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial. Led by the Breast International Group and several other organizations in addition to AstraZeneca and Merck, the massive trial\\u2019 s endpoint was invasive disease-free survival. AstraZeneca and Merck presented the data at a European Society for Medical Oncology Virtual Plenary. Primary results from the trial were also published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The study showed Lynparza reduced the risk of death in breast cancer patients by 32% versus placebo. The three-year survival rate increased from 89.1% with placebo to 92.8% with Lynparza. At four years, the survival rate was 86.4% with placebo and 89.8% with the drug. Lynparza's performance in the OlympiA trial is glowing, but it\\u2019 s also not surprising, as the latest data is consistent with previous studies. The drug has proved so successful in previous trials that it is already approved in the U.S., EU and Japan to treat patients with gBRCAm, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer previously treated with chemotherapy. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Lynparza just last week as the first and only targeted adjuvant therapy with an indication specifically for patients with gBRCAm, HER2-negative high-risk early breast cancer. Safety and tolerability results were also in line with previous data. While the statistics alone are impressive, there are several other reasons the study is significant. All patients in the study had mutations in the BRCA gene, which makes breast cancer more difficult to treat. Additionally, Lynparza is the first PARP inhibitor to ever show an overall survival benefit in patients with early breast cancer. PARPs, a category of protein that helps damaged cells repair themselves, include BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are known to cause breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. When the protein mutates, it causes cancer. PARP inhibitors, including Lynparza, are immunotherapy drugs that target mutated cancer cells and trap the strands of DNA when they break apart to replicate. Lynparza may also be useful in treating other kinds of cancers caused by genetic mutations. \\u201c These exciting results further support how LYNPARZA could significantly change the way people with germline BRCA-mutated early breast cancer are treated, \\u201d said Susan Galbraith, executive vice president of oncology R & D at AstraZeneca. \\u201c The OlympiA trial is the first time we\\u2019 ve seen a PARP inhibitor deliver survival benefit in early breast cancer, highlighting the importance of persistent innovation in tackling cancer early. \\u201d OlympiA\\u2019 s study is great news for cancer patients, as well as for pharmaceutical sales. Immuno-oncology drugs are a market expected to top $ 34 billion by 2030. AstraZeneca is the world\\u2019 s top-earning company in terms of immuno-oncology drugs, with $ 13.66 billion in revenue from that category of drugs alone in 2021. Lynparza was listed as a top seller from AstraZeneca. Merck is also a leader in terms of immuno-oncology drug sales, with Lynparza standing out as one of its most profitable products.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"datatype\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"science\",\n          \"annual_report\",\n          \"esg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 834,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2021-11-13\",\n          \"2022-01-29\",\n          \"2021-12-14\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"internal\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"symbol\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 39,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"ZAL\",\n          \"BAS\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10961,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Mavenir 4G/5G Open vRAN deployed at Deutsche Telekom O-RAN Town\",\n          \"How a clean and sober Jan Ullrich pedaled back from the brink\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"id":"tg867QOXoMNI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732449313030,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1014,"user":{"displayName":"Palak Gupta","userId":"13078129497906859328"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import unicodedata\n","\n","def normalize_unicode(text):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Normalizes Unicode text by converting it to its closest ASCII representation.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    return unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', text).encode('ascii', 'ignore').decode('utf-8')\n","# drop rows with NaN values in the 'content' column\n","df.dropna(subset=['content'], inplace=True)\n","\n","# apply the normalization function to the cleaned_content column\n","df['content'] = df['content'].apply(normalize_unicode)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":9,"status":"ok","timestamp":1732449313032,"user":{"displayName":"Palak Gupta","userId":"13078129497906859328"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"ddh9Ujc6BCSq","outputId":"b04da910-8a53-495d-f3c8-d9f28b281452"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["17"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}],"source":["temp = df[df['date'].isin([\"p.DE-03-31\", \"bayer-03-31\"])]\n","len(temp)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":934,"status":"ok","timestamp":1732449313959,"user":{"displayName":"Palak Gupta","userId":"13078129497906859328"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"bH4ckH7BwFMs","outputId":"95f1c57f-080b-480c-f5f3-7cc5f0e51381"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["          company                                            content  \\\n","13         Henkel  Sustainability Report 2020 About this report T...   \n","18         Henkel  Sustainability Report 2018 About this report T...   \n","20       Bayer AG  Five-Year Summary Bayer Annual Report 2018 Fiv...   \n","22  Volkswagen AG  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020 CONTENTS FOREWORD A...   \n","25   Sartorius AG  Sartorius Group 2021 Annual Report Key Figures...   \n","26        Porsche  Courage.

They are also placing more and more value on understanding the impact of our processes and products along the value chain. Among investors, interest in sustainability is growing and the related topics are receiving increased coverage in the media. Likewise, dialog about sustainability topics on public platforms such as social media is increasing. In addition, at the political level, we have seen great progress toward a shared understanding of global priorities over the last few years, most notably the global climate agreement in Paris in 2015, as well as the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We are convinced that our focus on sustainability and our unwavering commitment are important right now  and that they also underline the future viability of our company. This includes making an effective contribution to global sustainable development while also reinforcing Henkels business success. This focus supports our growth, helps to increase our cost-efficiency and reduces risks. Our many years of work have created a strong foundation and we have built a track record of success. Henkels leading role in sustainability is confirmed by numerous international ratings and rankings. Using the energy of our employees and the great reach of our brands and technologies, we aim to further expand our contribution to sustainable development  along the entire value chain and in collaboration with our partners. Our interim targets so far, as well as our next interim targets for 2025, represent important milestones on the journey toward our long-term goal of becoming three times more efficient by 2030. We continuously align our goals and initiatives with global and national priorities to ensure we are working on the issues that are relevant to our business and to sustainable development. This involves dialog with our stakeholders. We engage in initiatives together with industry representatives and civil society organizations worldwide, while also participating in political and public discussions.  Based on our strong track record and progress in implementing our consumers, customers, business partners and society, in which we sustainability strategy along the value chain, we aim to enhance sus-aim to speed up our contribution to sustainable development: tainability as a clear feature differentiating us from the competition. becoming climate-positive by 2040, fostering a circular economy, To do so, we have defined three areas of particular importance to and contributing to social progress. *Excluding products where ingredients or residue may affect recyclability or pollute recycling streams.  We reduce the environmental footprint We strive to reduce our environmental footprint along the value chain through important activities covered by our focal areas of energy and climate, materials and waste, and water and wastewater. By adopting the Paris Climate Agreement, the UN member states made a commitment to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit this increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Henkel is committed to helping to reach this target. We are starting by focusing on our own production, which we can influence directly. We also want to reduce the footprint of the raw materials and packag<BR>ing that we use. As a result, we expect our suppliers and contract partners to set targets that are as ambitious as our own  and contribute to the reduction of CO2 throughout their supply chain. In terms of our environmental footprint along the value chain, the product usage phase has the largest impact. For this reason, we also want to leverage the potential of our brands and technologies to help our customers and consumers to save CO2 when using our products. Our focal area of materials and waste also includes the responsible use of resources and our goal of reducing the volume of waste generated by our company. In addition, we have set ambitious targets for our product packaging. With this, we plan to further drive progress toward a circular economy. This includes developing Henkels packaging so that it is recyclable or reusable. We have also set ourselves targets for the percentage of recycled plastic in the packaging for our consumer products. In the focal area of water and wastewater, it is our goal to reduce water consumption during production and avoid generating wastewater. We also focus on developing products that enable our customers and consumers to make their own contribution to saving water. Our detergents, household cleaners, cosmetic and body care products that enter wastewater after use have been developed so that they have the least possible impact on the environment. Wastewater from industrial facilities is pre-treated with state-of-the-art technologies and disposed of professionally. Strengthening the central role of our employees When it comes to implementing our sustainability strategy, it is our people who make the difference  through their dedication, skills and knowledge. They make their contributions to sustainable development in their daily business lives and as members of society. They are the interface to our customers and consumers, and other stakeholders such as suppliers, investors, research institutions and NGOs. Working in areas such as purchasing, finance, research and development, production, marketing and sales, they are active along our value chain and collaborate with our partners. They make innovations possible, develop strategies and make our company unique. Because of this, we want to foster our peoples commitment to sustainability and expand our existing training courses to include a comprehensive engagement program. This builds on the Sustain<BR>ability Ambassador program that we initiated in 2012, which empowers and encourages employees to engage even more strongly with the topic of sustainability. Going forward, we will intensify our efforts to provide our people with even more extensive knowledge and skills in order to strengthen our companys position as a leader in sustainability. Employees create sustainable value and act as ambassadors The ongoing commitment of our people is important to ensure that sustainability is embedded in all business activities. This enables us to shape our future together and create sustainable value. Employees as Sustainability Ambassadors Since the introduction of the Sustainability Ambassador program, we have trained more than 50,000 Sustainability Ambassadors at our locations worldwide. We have expanded the training programs in recent years to deepen our understanding of sustainability within the company, and to train and encourage all of our employees to become Sustainability Ambassadors. We reach our employees through an eLearning program on our central global learning platform, as well as through team training sessions that we organize worldwide using standardized training materials. In addition to discussing the fundamental principles of sustainability  from concept to key global challenges  the training program also explains how Henkel is responding to these challenges and implementing sustainability. In 2020, we also developed an eLearning program specifically for packaging and plastics. It is available online to employees worldwide. The Sustainability Ambassador program remains an integral part of the onboarding process for new employees. We also provided our employees with extensive information about climate protection in 2020. The communication campaign included dialog with experts and tips for how to save energy. Motivating Sustainability Ambassadors to make a contribution We want to do more than just communicate information about sustainability to our employees. We also want to motivate them to become involved in sustainability. With their skills and knowledge, they can act as ambassadors to make an important contribution to sustainability at our sites, and by engaging with our customers and other partners within our business environment. Henkels Sustainability Ambassadors are encouraged to visit schools to teach children about sustainable behavior in the home. This helps the next generation to understand how to use resources efficiently from an early age. At the same time, the children multiply the impact by imparting their knowledge and their enthusiasm to others around them. From the start of the project in 2012 until the end of 2020, we reached around 175,000 schoolchildren in 54 countries. School visits are an important element in our commitment to reaching schoolchildren through educational initiatives. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our Sustainability Ambassadors were severely limited in their ability to visit schools in 2020. As a result, we developed an eLearning course to continue informing children about this topic and engaging in dialog with them. In our Sustainability Ambassador program, we also aim to promote healthier lifestyles and greater awareness of water consumption, energy usage and waste generation across our sites. One element of this commitment is our (Y)our move toward sustainability initiative, which was introduced in 2014. It encourages employees to practice sustainability in their day-to-day work, for example by avoiding unnecessary printing, switching off lights or eating healthily. The customers we reach with our brands and technologies are an important target group. Our Say yes! to the future initiative, for example, provides Henkel sales representatives from all business units around the world with training in sustainability topics that apply to sales, going beyond the content of the Sustainability Ambassador program. They then apply this knowledge in joint projects with our trade partners  in logistics, for example, or by promoting sustainable purchasing decisions. In addition, we want to give our employees opportunities to engage in volunteer projects and make their own contribution to the communities in which we operate. To support our employees and retirees around the world in their voluntary and social engagement in charitable institutions, we launched the Make an Impact on Tomorrow (MIT Volunteering) initiative in 1998. We support projects through product and in-kind donations, as well as by sharing expertise or investing time through paid leave. Our basic principle is: The larger the initiative, the more support Henkel will provide. Through the great commitment of our active and retired employees, as well as through project reports, we ensure that our resources are used fully, responsibly, and transparently where they are most needed. Henkel is creating significant momentum through the MIT initiative, with volunteers reporting better teamwork, greater job motivation through appreciation of their personal commitment, and stronger identification with Henkels corporate culture. The committed employees and retirees also play a pivotal role as a link between Henkel and the local community, by acting as ambassadors for our company and our corporate culture. How we further develop our strategy, goals and concepts Society and companies face numerous challenges and new developments. These include aspects such as the environment, employee and social topics, respecting human rights, and combating corruption and bribery. The challenges and developments are also reflected in the international Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For the development of our sustainability strategy and the definition of the related goals, we engage in dialog with the Management Board and form working groups that act under the guidance of the Sustain<BR>ability Council. In these groups, we evaluate trends and developments, while also reviewing the expectations of our stakeholders and analyzing our environmental footprint along the value chain. We identify relevant topics To determine and categorize relevant topics for our business activities and reporting, we engage in a continuous process of recording and evaluating the challenges and opportunities of sustainable development using various tools. We assess the importance of the topics for the company, environment and society, and also for our stakeholders. When selecting the topics, we go beyond the definition of materiality included within the CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG) in conjunction with Sections () 289b to 289e of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The COVID-19 pandemic has also emphasized the central role of our people  because the well-being of our employees is our top priority at all times. We do everything we can to ensure their health and safety, whether on site or working flexibly from home, while ensuring the continuity of our business. In this respect, we have created new communication formats for virtual dialog. In the Henkel Heroes campaign, we also introduced colleagues who inspired us by making a positive contribution to our corporate culture during the pandemic. In 2020, Henkel also made a commitment to the communities we operate in as part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We launched an comprehensive global solidarity program, for example, by producing disinfectants and donating them to hospitals and public institutions.

Schwarzkopfs Million Chances initiative was launched in 2016 to support women and girls in building a successful future for themselves. Henkel is also the main sponsor of the Teach First Deutschland initiative. In this way, we support the commitment of university graduates who, as additional teachers, support schoolchildren in schools in socially disadvantaged communities. Promoting sustainable palm oil As part of our responsibility, we aim to support sustainable practices in the palm oil industry along the entire value chain. By supporting sustainable palm (kernel) oil, we contribute to sustainable forest management and prevent deforestation. Collaboration with representatives from across the industry is at the heart of our approach. We aim to increase the availability of sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil on the market, for example, through collaborative projects that enable smallholder farmers to certify their crops as sustainable, increase productivity and improve their livelihoods. Turning waste into opportunities We want to reduce the flow of waste into the sea, while also contributing to protecting our oceans. In 2017, Henkel became the first major global consumer goods company to work with the social enterprise Plastic Bank. In 2019, we extended this partnership for another five years. Since the start of the collaboration, Plastic Bank has opened several collection points for plastic waste in Haiti with the help of Henkel. The local population can return collected plastic to the collection centers and exchange it for money, goods or services. This creates value from waste before it can enter waterways or the sea. Promoting sustainable consumption We support the goal of promoting sustainable and resource-efficient consumption. Our products and technologies are key to this because they are used in millions of households and industrial processes every day. We focus on developing products that lead to resource efficiency in everyday use. We also strive to encourage responsible use of our products through targeted communication. This is important because the environmental footprint of many of our products is determined during the use phase. The Henkel footprint calculator helps individuals to calculate their CO2 footprint. 35 36 The Sustainability Council sets up project groups to deal with development departments of our three business units work on key sustainability topics, and monitors the results. It also handles cross-departmental projects and regularly monitors the extent to which sustainability goals are met. This includes the progress of our climate-related corporate targets and initiatives, for example. technologies and supply the basis for tomorrows sustainable products. Regional and national companies Managers in the regional and national companies steer the implementation of Henkel standards and compliance with legal requirements in their respective regions. With the support of the corporate functions and the operating business units, they develop an implementation strategy appropriate to the individual sites and their local circumstances. Corporate functions Through their representatives, our corporate functions support the implementation of our sustainability strategy in their respective areas of responsibility. For example, they develop appropriate supplier management tools or systems for measuring greenhouse gas emissions. Key sustainability topics for Henkel are coordinated by a specialist unit that reports directly to the Management Board and which serves as the company-wide interface for sustainability. Management conferences and working groups In addition to the central role of the Sustainability Council and the interaction between the various units and functions, international management conferences and the sharing of information in specialist committees form an important basis for the ongoing development of Henkels sustainability policy. These meetings deal with new scientific findings, practical experience, changes in laws and regulations, and other current topics. The objective is to initiate new projects within Henkel, as well as to further develop approaches to solving problems and to encourage employees to share their experiences with one another. 52  Natural bonding Renewable raw materials such as starch, cellulose, dextrins and proteins are used in many consumer and craftsmen adhesives, as well as in industrial adhesives for a wide range of applications. For example, we utilize renewable raw materials in glue sticks, wallpaper pastes and packaging adhesives. Bottle labeling adhesives contain as much as around 45 percent renewable raw materials. Using sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil At Henkel, we recognize our responsibilities regarding the purchase and use of ingredients based on renewable raw materials. For this reason, we are committed to ensuring that the ingredients for our products are made from sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil. With this in mind, we work both with the companies from which we source our raw materials and with other partners to exert influence on the palm oil supply chain, from smallholders to consumers. We have made considerable progress in this respect with a wide range of measures in recent years. In fiscal year 2020, we were able to source 90 percent of our total demand for palm oil and palm kernel oil, together with the derivatives mainly used by Henkel, as certified raw materials in line with the RSPOs Mass Balance model. In some markets, unfortunately, certified raw materials are still not available to us locally, due to insufficient demand in certain emerging markets. In these cases we join forces with our suppliers to look for solutions or, alternatively, we have to import raw materials, at a corresponding cost in terms of time and effort. Additionally, a number of derivatives of palm-kernel-oil-based raw materials that we use in Smallholder projects promote sustainable production Smallholders produce 40 percent of the worlds palm oil, yet their productivity and quality levels are much lower compared to large plantations. They often lack access to technical knowledge and to financial services that are crucial to improving their production. Some smallholders are also concerned that access to the palm oil market will be limited if their harvests do not meet the criteria set out by the RSPO. This is because many major buyers of palm oil have committed to buying only oil products that are certified as sustainable. Together with the development organization Solidaridad, Henkel is addressing these challenges. It is currently engaged in seven initiatives in Colombia, Ghana, Honduras, Indonesia, Mexico, Nicaragua and Nigeria to find innovative, market-based solutions focused on increasing the yield for smallholders. The focus is on training in best practice approaches, including climate-friendly agriculture, along with exerting an influence on policy and involving stakeholders. To date, around 34,000 smallholders have been reached on some 305,000 hectares under cultivation. Another project phase was completed with our support in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, in 2020. The project was launched in 2016 and has already provided support for a large number of smallholders on their path to certification by the RSPO. The scope of the project has now been expanded through input from Henkel and BASF. By training more than 2,000 smallholders in how to increase yields and prevent environmental damage through the right farming practices, yields have increased on average by up to 20 percent annually. In addition, a new project was launched in Nigeria together with Solidaridad in 2020, which will involve building four nurseries for seedlings. Improved varieties will be grown in these nurseries, leading to an increase in crop yields while avoiding deforestation through new planting. The nurseries will be accompanied by training courses that teach sustainable land use practices and topics related to forest conservation. Special schools for women and young people are also being set up to promote them in agribusiness and to train them in entrepreneurial skills. Rajasthan, India. They learn sustainable guar farming methods and receive valuable advice on planting their own vegetable gardens. All product formulas were developed so that they primarily consist of natural substances. Nature Box also supports sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil production together with Solidaridad. Together for a sustainable supply chain In 2011, Henkel and five other companies in the chemical industry introduced the initiative Together for Sustainability  Chemical Supply Chains for a Better World (TfS). It is based on the principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the Responsible Care Initiative of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA). TfS aims to harmonize increasingly complex supply chain management processes with regard to sustainability and to optimize dialog among worldwide business partners. Above all, synergies are to be created so that resources can be used more efficiently and with a minimum of administrative effort, not only among the member companies but also with all of our shared suppliers. The core elements of the TfS initiative are audits and online assessments. The audits are carried out by a number of selected, independent audit companies. For the online assessments, TfS cooperates with EcoVadis, a service provider specialized in sustainability performance assessments. The TfS initiative has grown strongly in recent years and now consists of 29 members that represent a total spend of more than 225 billion euro. In 2020, the initiatives reach within the supply chains of the chemical industry was further expanded by seven new companies that joined TfS. At the heart of the initiative is the core idea: An audit for one is an audit for all!: Suppliers only have to undergo one assessment or one audit conducted by independent experts. Around 16,000 assessments and audits have been carried out since TfS was founded. Performance is assessed in the areas of management, environment, health and safety, labor and human rights, and issues of ethical corporate governance. The measures then introduced are reviewed via re-assessments or re-audits. Follow-up monitoring and subsequent supplier management are the responsibility of the individual member companies. An online platform is used to make the results available to all members of the initiative. In September 2020, TfS launched its new strategic framework TfS Grow&Deliver. This new strategy builds on the initiatives past achievements and will shift TfS away from collaboration that is focused on measurement and toward becoming a community that makes a tangible impact together. TfS members will continue their commitment to promoting higher standards, as well as improving the insights and data gathered from assessments and audits. This will enable TfS to train suppliers in topics and areas that offer the largest Supplier development In 2020, Henkel put a special focus on supplier development and capability building related to responsible sourcing and sustainability topics. In 28 webinars, around 3,000 participants of our supplier base received training about Henkels Responsible Sourcing Process, the TfS initiative, and the EcoVadis assessment process. In addition, more than 900 Henkel employees within our Purchasing team received training about our achievements related to responsible sourcing and our strategy for building on these achievements in the future. The training was provided in Chinese, English, German, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish. In addition, TfS hosted its supplier training for Chinese petrochemical companies again in 2020. This years session took place at the China Petroleum and Chemical International Conference (CPCIC) in Nanjing with around 500 participants, including suppliers and representatives from TfS members and industry organizations. The training focused on how to build a sustainable supply chain, as well as the specific requirements for chemical companies. 68 Based on our achievements, we have set ambitious targets for 2025 and beyond to further improve our performance and continue to reduce our footprint. These targets cover CO2 emissions and waste, as well as water consumption. We are striving to achieve them by following a comprehensive approach at the corporate level that involves strong collaboration between our business units. Driving efficiency In line with our aim to continuously improve our entire production network, we began introducing the Henkel Production System (HPS) in 2015. Through this group-wide optimization program, we want to systematically identify and eliminate all inefficiencies like waiting times, excess production or defects from our value chain. We have set We are also striving to save energy by optimizing our spraydrying towers, which are used to make powder that forms the basis for many of our laundry detergents. This process accounts for a relevant share of energy consumed by our Laundry & Home Care business unit at our site in Dusseldorf, Germany. For this reason, collecting more data about energy consumption within this process opens up opportunities to increase efficiency and reduce the related carbon footprint. To drive data-driven decarbonization, sensoring granularity is gradually being augmented. For example, we installed additional sensors inside and outside of the spraydrying towers in Dusseldorf to gather more data, which we then make available within our global Digital Backbone system. Following the success of this pilot project, we are implementing this data-driven approach across all of our factories that produce washing powder with spraydrying towers. This will allow us to identify opportunities to further increase energy efficiency by analyzing data and benchmarking against other sites. Our measures to improve efficiency also include implementing heat recovery systems. The implementation of one of these systems at our site in Port Said, Egypt, has contributed to reducing energy consumption at the site by around 20 percent since 2018. The system recovers hot air that is emitted from the spray tower and uses it to heat up fresh air when it enters the tower burner. Currently, we are also implementing heat recovery systems at our production sites in Ferentino, Italy, and Mornag, Tunisia. Standards and management systems Globally uniform standards for Safety, Health, and Environment (SHE) and integrated management systems provide the basis for our worldwide optimization programs. Our SHE Standards and our Social Standards apply to all sites. Our management systems ensure that these standards are implemented consistently across our global production network. External certification of our management systems in 2020 Code Standard for Percentage of production volume covered ISO 14001 Environmental management 81 percent systems ISO 9001 Quality management systems 83 percent ISO 50001 Energy management systems 52 percent ISO 45001 Occupational health and safety 46 percent management systems OHSAS 18001 Occupational health and safety 79 percent management systems In 2018, we had sites certified according to the new ISO 45001, which was published in March 2018 and will replace the OHSAS 18001 certification over a transition period of three years. New multi-technology production sites When building new sites, we aim to integrate our ambitions related to efficiency and renewable energy as early as the design phase. For example, we have built a new high-tech facility in Songdo, South Korea, which has already started trial production. The new facility is designed as a smart factory that includes a comprehensive building management system. In addition, the production facilities are equipped with solar panels that meet high standards for sustainability. The solar panels incorporate our innovative Electrically Conductive Adhesives (ECAs) that maximize power output and optimize reliability. Furthermore, a rainwater recycling system is installed at the site, as well as highly efficiency equipment that minimizes energy consumption. The site also features specific areas that are designated as green spaces. The new site is applying to receive the LEED Gold certification (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), as well as a Korean Green building certification. 2,000 square meters of solar panels to the existing area of 7,000 square meters. Our new site for aerospace solutions in Montornes del Valles, Spain, opened in 2019 as a multi-technology production facility with high sustainability standards. It was the first production building in Spain to be awarded the golden DGNB certification. The site started operating in 2020 and our local team has continued to seek further ways of improving sustainability. For example, we installed an absorption chiller to generate cooling water. The chiller runs on renewable thermal energy that is generated by a biomass boiler. We also improved our warehouse and implemented movable racks in our freeze storage area for finished products. As a result, we have optimized the use of space, and less cooling capacity is needed compared to standard racks with corridors between them. Our Gebkim site in Turkey was recognized with the prestigious Sahabettin Bilgisu Environmental Award by the Chamber of Industry in the category Chemicals Industry in 2020. Becoming climate-positive by 2040 The UNs Paris Agreement on Climate Change represents a commitment by the community of nations to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To achieve this, carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced by 2050. Henkel is committed to the 1.5 degrees Celsius target and sees it as an essential prerequisite if more than nine billion people are to be able to live well within the resource limits of our planet in 2050. In light of the need to reduce emissions and decarbonize the economy, we pursue the vision to become a climate-positive company by 2040 by driving significant progress in our own operations and in other relevant areas of our value chain. By pursuing this goal, we will make an active and committed contribution toward climate protection. We start by focusing on our own production, which we can influ<BR>ence directly. The carbon footprint of our production is around 535,000 metric tons of CO2 and is attributable to the fuels we use ourselves (Scope 1) and the energy purchased (Scope 2), in particular electricity. On the way to becoming climate-positive by 2040, we aim to reduce the carbon footprint of our production by 65 percent by 2025 and by 75 percent by 2030 compared to the base year 2010. These targets support progress toward our long-term goal of becoming three times more efficient by 2030. To do so, we continually check and improve our energy efficiency, and set the target to reduce energy consumption at our production sites by 30 percent per ton of product by 2020 Alongside this achievement, we have been expanding our direct purchase of green power, and signed PPA agreements in countries including Austria, Hungary and Puerto Rico this year. This means the design and building of the respective energy generating facilities can start in the upcoming months. This includes energy delivery from the grid or from specific installations. By the end of 2020, we had fully converted 17 countries to 100 percent renewable electricity, and we managed to increase the proportion of our electricity purchase that comes from renewable sources to 56 percent during the second half of the year. We have concrete plans to accelerate our respective sourcing and continue to fully convert further countries to green power. In addition, we continued to expand the on-site generation of renewable energy at several of our production sites around the world. For instance, we have begun installing a biomass boiler that uses wood pellets from forest scraps at our site in Norrkoping, Sweden. It will replace the old steam and thermal boiler, and is expected to be complete in 2021. The new boiler will bring the site close to achieving climate neutrality. Overall, we have 37 ongoing projects to install photovoltaic systems at our sites. Nine projects are in the final phase of construction or are already generating energy. For example, the roof of our site in Kurkumbh, India, is covered by 7,000 square meters of solar panels that generate up to 1,000,000 kilowatt hours of energy per year. In addition, we completed a project to install rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate up to 30 percent of the total electricity consumption at our site in Gebkim, Turkey. This can save around 800 metric tons of CO2 per year. Further solar projects are being implemented in China and North America. A large freestanding photovoltaic system is being installed at our site in Wassertrudingen, Germany. It will produce around 1,650,000 kWh of electricity per year. Scenario for 2040 By 2040, we want to replace the last remaining fossil fuels used in our production with climate-neutral alternatives, such as biogas or gas obtained from converting CO2. We also aim to supply surplus carbon-neutral energy that Henkel does not need for its own purposes to third parties  thus becoming a climate-positive company. In doing so, we will avoid emissions from our own activities, and also enable third parties to avoid potential emissions by using clean energy. Using the potential of Industry 4.0 For Henkel, Industry 4.0 offers significant potential to drive progress toward achieving higher productivity, increased efficiency and greater flexibility through intelligent production processes. Automated systems and networked data will make the workflow of our company faster, more stable and more sustainable. Henkel is leveraging Industry 4.0 to better plan, source, produce and deliver its products and solutions. A key element is the smart factory, where intelligent machines control and optimize production processes based on real-time information and wireless interconnectivity. The digitalization of our integrated global supply chain is already increasing service levels for customers, managing production loca<BR>tions more efficiently, optimizing production and logistics processes, and further improving our sustainability performance. The production sites and processes for our Laundry & Home Care business unit worldwide are all connected, and all information is centrally collected in real time. As a result, digitalization is driving increased sustainability. In 2020, Henkel was recognized as an Advanced 4th Industrial Revolution Lighthouse by the World Economic Forum (WEF) for its state-of-the-art Laundry & Home Care production site in Dusseldorf, Germany. In a study that focused on how top companies are using Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies to improve operations, Henkel was recognized for its Digital Backbone, which uses the cloud to continuously link global operations from end-to-end. In addition, our Laundry & Home Care production site received external recognition as Factory of the Year from the management consultancy A.T. Kearney for its transformation from a historical production site into a modern, digital, sustainable and efficient facility. This transformation was made possible by measures such as the implementation of our Digital Backbone. As one element of our Digital Backbone, data from online metering systems at our laundry detergent production sites around the world is collected and processed. Using information from around 4,000 sensors, it records how much energy and water each site uses, and then displays this information visually. Applying big data analytics and artificial intelligence, the system can recognize patterns and identify potential for optimization. Since 2016, efficiency data from our production lines has also been fed into the system and analyzed. The real-time Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) quantifies how well a piece of equipment performs relative to its designed capacity. Thanks to a highly standardized equipment setup, our employees can view the relevant information for all other production sites worldwide, benchmark against best practice and jointly implement measures to improve production flows. Since the launch of its energy monitoring program in 2011, our Laundry & Home Care business unit has been able to reduce energy consumption by 30 percent. The platform is flexible, expandable and scalable. For this reason, more modules have been added that build on identical technology and management procedures for quality, safety, line efficiency and traceability. In 2020, we continued to leverage our global energy metering system by establishing standardized and digitalized energy review processes. The digital expert system allows high-level comparisons between production sites, and also enables an in-depth understanding of the energy consumption at a site, including a direct benchmarking against other sites. After implementing the pilot project in Montornes del Valles, the global roll-out has started and will be completed in 2021. Our Adhesive Technologies business unit uses a smart operations platform that enables the visualization, review and analysis of resource consumption. This makes it possible to identify optimization potential for our use of raw materials. The platform is running at sites across Asia-Pacific and the India, Middle East and Africa region, as well as at several sites in the US, which we connected to the system in 2020. Additionally, this platform has been developed to make even better use of data in order to further improve efficiency in raw material consumption, as well as water and energy use. The advanced use of data and automation also leads to a safer work environment. To ensure the highest quality in our finished goods, the Adhesive Technologies business unit is going to further develop its Statistical Quality Control tool to continue optimizing the use of resources globally. The COVID-19 pandemic challenged us to sharpen our focus on finding innovative solutions for staying connected, and we introduced Augmented Reality with smart glasses to facilitate audits and workshops remotely. This enabled us to create a safer work environment and to continue business even in these challenging times. In line with our approach to implementing automated systems and networked data in order to make our processes more efficient and sustainable, our Beauty Care business unit focused on a global metering and digitalization project for energy and water consumption data in 2020. As a first step, we conducted a mapping exercise to identify critical areas for improvement. By the end of 2020, new digital meters had been implemented, and were connected to the local Energy Management System (EMS) and collecting real-time data. In a next step, they will be connected to one global EMS. In parallel, the selection process of a new Manufacturing Operations Management How we optimize transport and logistics processes Expanding intermodal transport Improving our warehouse network Optimizing transport Digital tools for improved logistics Future mobility Logistics and transport Logistics and transport How we optimize transport and logistics processes Our responsibility along the entire value chain includes optimizing our transport and logistics processes in terms of environmental compatibility and resource efficiency. We set ourselves the overall aim to reduce the emissions from transporting our products by around 5 percent per ton of product between 2015 and 2020. At the end of 2020, we had gone beyond this target by reducing transportrelated emissions by more than 10 percent per ton of product compared to the base year 2015. Our new target for 2025 is to reduce our transport-related CO2 emissions by 15 percent per ton of product compared to 2015. We also aim to use renewable electricity at 50 percent of our pallet spaces within Henkel-operated warehouses by 2025. Our approach to reducing our logistics footprint starts in the product development stage. We optimize our products and the related packaging in terms of weight and volume, whenever it is possible to do so without compromising performance, convenience or stability. More concentrated products and lighter packaging reduce transport weight, which decreases the amount of fuel required during transport and reduces the related emissions. Alongside product and packaging optimization, we also reduce transport-related emissions by improving our logistics structures. Our approach takes the location of our production sites into account. For bulkier products, we reduce transport distances and environmental impact by operating regional production sites. For compact products, which place fewer demands on transport, we leverage efficiencies in production by manufacturing these products centrally whenever possible. For transportation and logistics for finished goods, we focus our efforts on three major drivers:  Expanding intermodal transport  Improving our warehouse network  Optimizing transport We leverage these drivers by collaborating with our suppliers and customers to implement joint logistics projects. In particular, we have extended our Say yes! to the future initiative to cover logistics. This initiative is part of our Sustainability Ambassador program and is now fostering best-practice exchange between our business units and initiating logistics projects in close collaboration with our customers. We also make use of advanced digital solutions to improve our logistics. In addition, using alternative mobility solutions is part of our approach to optimizing our transport and logistics. This allows us to make use of the lower CO2 footprint of rail transport compared to road transport, since a train emits about one-third of the CO2 of a truck when transporting the same weight of goods. For this reason, intermodal transport has become a key driver for CO2 reduction in logistics at Henkel. When choosing our transport partners, we consider efficiency, environmental compatibility and safety performance. Relevant criteria are included in our tendering and decision-making processes for the purchase of logistics services. These include the volume of potential emissions savings that would be achieved by each service provider, as well as their use of new technologies, alternative mobility solutions and energy-saving programs. Expanding intermodal transport Intermodal transport involves using more than one mode of transportation. At Henkel, this means more of our transports are being switched from road to rail. This process begins with a truck carrying the goods to the nearest rail loading terminal. From there, the goods cover longer distances by train, before a second truck collects the goods at the destination terminal and delivers them to the customer. addition, our Adhesive Technologies business unit also began consolidating five warehouses in Germany and Belgium. In 2020, four of these warehouses were consolidated into one new warehouse near Dusseldorf. The location of the warehouse was chosen based on the location of our customers, and it supports our efforts to ensure trucks are fully loaded when they travel from the factory to the warehouse. Downstream, the consolidation means customers that were initially supplied by several warehouses are now supplied by just one, which decreases transport emissions. The warehouse, which is the largest warehouse for our Adhesive Technologies business unit, was awarded the Sustainable Building for Logistics Gold certification from the DGNB (German Sustainable Building Council). It is equipped with state-of-the-art technology to reduce energy consumption and features advanced processes for sorting waste in collaboration with waste recyclers. It began operating in the second half of 2019, and an average of 500 metric tons of products are dispatched from this warehouse each day. In 2019, our Beauty Care business unit relocated its warehouse activities from our site in Willebroek in Belgium to a new warehouse in the Netherlands. This shift was agreed following an evaluation of the business units delivery operations in 2017, which indicated that the focal point of deliveries in the Benelux region was located in the region of Heteren in the Netherlands. The subsequent warehouse relocation made it possible to reduce the delivery distance to this logistics center by 125 kilometers, which reduces CO2 emissions. In 2020, our new Laundry & Home Care warehouse opened in Toluca, Mexico. It consolidates seven warehouses into one location, which has eliminated the need for more than 1,000 internal shipments per day. Another milestone in the optimization of our warehouse network was achieved with the opening of our state-of-the-art, fully automated Laundry & Home Care warehouse in Montornes del Valles (near Barcelona), Spain, in November 2020. The warehouse, which is equipped with 80 solar panels on its roof, will optimize our internal process by consolidating eight warehouses. This new warehouse is estimated to reduce CO2 emissions by 60 percent. As this program spans the supply chains of all three of our business units, it is managed by a Green Logistic group at Henkel France. This group worked with an external consulting firm to identify key actions to implement the program successfully. These include pooling, development of transport solutions and deployment of alternative transport modes. The Cost to Serve approach is a further concept that fosters the optimization of transport processes. This approach involves identifying measures to maximize profitability by assessing the cost of serving a customer within the existing supply chain. It was integrated into the operations of our Beauty Care business unit in Western and Eastern Europe in 2019. In 2020, we increased our focus on the Cost to Serve approach and expanded the scope to cover our professional Hair Salon business. In the course of applying this concept, order management and delivery profiles were optimized so that delivery frequencies could be lowered and truck fill rates could be increased. This contributed to the overall profitability of Henkel Beauty Cares logistics processes and also allowed us to transport more goods with fewer deliveries, which leads to reductions in transport-related CO2 emissions. In April 2020, Henkel also established a new vehicle policy in Germany for electric and hybrid cars. This gives our employees the opportunity to drive an electric or hybrid vehicle as a company car. In addition, Henkel provides a complete service package including a power charging station for home use and the reimbursement of electricity costs for charging at home. With the extended electric and hybrid car policy, we aim to make low-emission company cars more attractive. We started to equip the internal vehicle fleet at our site in Maribor, Slovenia, with its first electric vehicles in 2020. Several electrical forklifts and an electric van were introduced, and the project is scheduled to continue in 2021. In 2020, we also made a strong push toward more efficient equipment at our production site in Krusevac, Serbia, by purchasing new forklift trucks that run on Lithium Ion (LION) batteries. The technology offers many advantages over traditional lead-acid battery technology, including improved safety and better performance, as well as zero maintenance requirements. While using electric vehicles is one approach, we also strive to integrate further alternatives into our business operations. In March 2019, the first hydrogen-powered car was added to Henkels internal fleet at our site in Dusseldorf. This project is a future-oriented investment because the network of hydrogen charging stations in Germany is expected to further expand within the next few years. At the same location, we contributed to this development in January 2019 by providing a suitable place for the company Air Liquide to install its second hydrogen charging station in Dusseldorf. To promote hydrogen mobility, Henkel is actively engaged in various initiatives and research projects, such as Modellregion Wasserstoffmobilitat NRW Dussel.Rhein.Wupper.. We do not expect hydrogen mobility solutions that are suitable for our logistics operations to be available before 2023. For this reason, we are exploring several alternatives for sustainable logistics that are ready to contribute today. The deployment of conventional combustion engines that run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), which is mainly composed of methane, is one of the technologies that we are implementing into our business operations as part of our journey toward more sustainable mobility. CNG produces the least amount of CO2 of all types of fossil fuel combustion. In 2019, our Laundry & Home Care business unit implemented a pilot project that deployed a truck powered by CNG combustion for round-trip deliveries between Serbia and Austria. The CNG powered truck saves up to 15 percent of CO2 emissions on this route compared to a conventional diesel truck. After the successful pilot project, two more CNG trucks were introduced in 2020. In this way, the percentage of our Laundry & Home Care shipments that are transported by CNG trucks on the route from Austria to Serbia increased to 40 percent. Trucks powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG) are another alternative mobility solution for Henkel. Since September 2020, two LNG-powered trucks have been traveling on our supply routes from Dusseldorf to Bonen, Germany, and Barcelona, Spain. The technology saves 20 percent of CO2 compared to conventional diesel trucks. Alongside transport to locations outside of our companys premises, we also make use of alternative transport modes for internal deliveries at our sites. In the context of future mobility, we also seek to reduce transport-related emissions by generating a holistic, modern and sustainable concept to foster our staffs mobility. For our activities in this area, Henkel was awarded the Dusseldorfer Mobilitatspreis (Mobility award of the city of Dusseldorf) in November 2019. The support of our employees for projects related to staff mobility can, for example, be seen in our Germany-wide bike-leasing program. The program was launched in May 2019, and more than 1,200 bikes had been handed out to our employees by the end of 2020. 92 Sustainability stewardship How we develop sustainable products If we are to decouple increased quality of life from resource use, product innovations will play an essential role. For this reason, our products provide key leverage points for implementing our sustainability strategy. They should offer customers and consumers more value and better performance with a smaller environmental footprint. A high degree of innovativeness is very important in achieving this. In 2020, Henkel employed an average of around 2,600 people in research and development, and invested 495 million euros in these activities. In order to steer product development in line with our sustainability strategy from the outset, criteria for assessing sustainability have been systematically anchored into the Henkel innovation process since 2008. The focus is on innovations that help our customers and consumers to use less energy and reduce their own CO2 footprint. Evaluating sustainability in the Henkel innovation process The Henkel focal areas have been systematically anchored into our innovation process since 2008. At a certain point in the process, our researchers must demonstrate the specific advantages of their project in regard to product performance, added value for customers and  Advocating sustainable consumption together with partners An important objective of our strategy is to promote sustainable consumption that conserves resources. Our products are the key here. They are used in millions of households and industrial processes every day. This is why we concentrate on developing products that enable resources such as energy and water to be used efficiently during everyday life. Our aim is to save 100 million metric tons of CO2 emissions by 2025 through our products and by helping our customers and consumers with our expertise. Through targeted communication, we also strive to encourage responsible-minded behavior while using our products. This is especially important because the environmental footprint of many of our products is determined to a large extent during the use phase. The importance of the use phase is also shown in the Henkel footprint calculator, which was revised in 2020. It shows that not only companies, but also each individual can make a contribution to greater sustainability through their behavior. The calculator enables users to calculate their personal carbon footprint in just a few minutes. By answering simple questions, they can quickly estimate how much CO2 they generate through their own lifestyle in the areas of housing, food, mobility or vacations and leisure activities. By using this calculator, consumers can assess the climate compatibility of their everyday behavior, while also supporting the Wuppertal Institutes current research on sustainable lifestyles. Each participant can contribute to the empirical database by allowing their anonymized results to be used for a better understanding of consumer behavior. The educational partnership Understanding through Experiencing between Henkel and the retailer dm-drogerie markt took place again in 2020. Over a period of several months, 32 Henkel trainees and dm apprentices deal intensively with sustainability and develop their own projects in mixed teams. The partnership enables the participants to see the bigger picture. Young people from different professional backgrounds can share ideas in joint projects to develop awareness of the many-sided aspects of sustainability. Most of the energy used for washing dishes and doing laundry is involved in heating up the water. Even lowering the water temperature from 40 to 30 degrees Celsius can save up to 40 percent of the energy consumed per wash load. Many detergents now also work well in cold water. We have been working intensively to develop alternative test methods ourselves for more than 40 years. Together with the relevant industry associations, our aim is to convince the authorities to abandon animal testing. We also believe that being present in these markets and supporting the anti-animal testing agenda will ultimately help to increase acceptance of alternatives. Henkel is one of the companies which, together with the European Commission and a number of industry associations, established the European Partnership on Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA) in 2005. Since then, the partnership has advanced numerous projects, successfully pro<BR>moted alternatives to animal testing and made them available for safety assessment under the REACH Regulation. Wherever possible, questions regarding the skin compatibility of ingredients are now investigated with the help of in-vitro tests. In-vitro tests have been developed over the past decades by Henkel in cooperation with external partners. They have been proposed for international recognition by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as a substitute method for animal testing. In November 2020, Henkel completed the acquisition of the epiCS skin model technology developed by SkinInVitro GmbH. The closing of this acquisition was preceded by an extended and successful technology transfer phase, which guarantees the continued production of epiCS with the same high level of quality. The epiCS skin model will now be manufactured in the Henkel laboratories in Dusseldorf, Germany, under the Phenion brand. The epiCS technol<BR>ogy includes reconstructed human epidermal equivalents that have received official approval from the OECD for assessing the skin<BR>corrosive potential and, since April 2019, also for assessing the skin<BR>irritating potential of chemicals. 105 106  Recyclability: Today, mechanical recycling is the dominant recycling technology for plastic packaging. In this process, plastic is melted and turned into pellets for further use. A range of adhesives and coatings for flexible packaging are designed specifically for this type of recycling and support the recycling of mono-material packaging like Polypropylene (PP) and Polyethylene (PE) with optimized recyclate quality. We also offer a growing number of adhesives and coatings that have been tested for compatibility with paper recycling.  Debonding incompatible materials: Debonding enables different materials to be returned to the loop separately. In such cases, it is of the utmost importance that the adhesive can be removed from surfaces without leaving any residue. We offer labeling adhesives for PET containers that allow clean debonding, which enables material separation in the recycling process and creates a higher quality of recyclate output.  New designs that enable recycling: To enable the recycling of packaging that includes our adhesives and coatings, we focus on minimizing complexity regarding materials used for production and simplifying the packaging structures where possible. Together with our partners along the value chain, we work on new designs for the packaging industry that enable recycling in existing recycling processes. Partnerships along the value chain We engage in cross-industry initiatives Progress toward sustainability in packaging will only be possible if organizations from all stages of the packaging value chain work together. Henkels experts are engaged in several cross-industry initiatives to drive innovation in packaging development and to find effective solutions that can be developed on a large scale. Henkel has also teamed up with different organizations that are working on improving recycling infrastructure to enable a circular economy. Appropriate systems for recycling packaging materials are not in place in many areas, especially in developing countries. We believe that partnerships along the value chain are the only way we can make sure our product packaging can be recycled or reused after the product has been consumed. Henkel is also committed to cross-industry initiatives for sustainable packaging. Henkel is a founding member of a new initiative focusing on plastic waste, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW). Since 2019, more than 80 international companies from along the value chain for plastics and consumer goods have joined forces to tackle the global challenge of a circular economy together. The aim of the Using the slogan Be smarter. Recycle., the Beauty Care business unit provides information about the correct handling of waste and the recyclability of various types of packaging. In this way, we want to raise consumer awareness about the concept of a circular economy. The Be smarter. initiative covers 31 countries, also reaching consumers in countries where recycling systems for packaging are much less developed than in Germany, for example. Logos on our product packaging aim to educate consumers and encourage responsible behavior. Partnership with Plastic Bank Plastic Bank is a social enterprise that aims to stop plastic pollution from entering the oceans, while also providing opportunities for people in poverty. Henkel started working with Plastic Bank in 2017, and was the first major global consumer goods company to part<BR>ner with the organization and successfully incorporate the plastic collected into some of its product packaging. Since the beginning of the partnership, five new plastic collection centers have been estab<BR>lished in Haiti, a country that lacks adequate waste management infrastructure. Local communities can return collected plastic waste and exchange it for money, goods, or social benefits. This creates value from plastic instead of letting it enter waterways or oceans as waste. The plastic that is collected in Haiti is then sorted and can subsequently be introduced into the recycling value chain as Social Plastic. This is material that has been verified by Plastic Bank to indicate that the collectors received an above-market price for the plastic waste. The recycled Social Plastic can be used in products or packaging, which closes the material cycle. 560 metric tons of Social Plastic were processed for Henkel in 2020, and a total of more than 760 metric tons have been processed for Henkel since the part<BR>nership began in 2017. In 2019, Henkel extended this partnership with Plastic Bank for another five years. Following the success of the partnership launched in 2017, Henkel intends to support ongoing projects in Haiti, the Philippines and Indonesia. The company will also make a significant contribution to establishing an infrastructure of more than 400 plastic collection points in Egypt. By working together, the aim is to increase the availability of Social Plastic as a resource for the production of packaging. The development of collection infrastructure in Egypt will create additional capacities of up to 5,000 metric tons per year. This is equivalent to one billion bottles over a period of five years. In addition, Henkel helped the social enterprise to set up a supply chain that ensures that the collected plastic waste can be processed and recycled, so that it can ultimately be reintegrated into the value chain. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed development of the collection infrastructure in Egypt, with the result that collection activities did not begin until the fall of 2020. The first Henkel product packaging with Social Plastic was launched in October 2018. Since the end of 2019, PET bottle bodies of Pro Nature cleaners from the brands Biff, Pril and Sidolin, as well as bottles of the fabric softeners Vernel Naturals and Fresh Control, have been made of 100 percent recycled plastic, up to 50 percent of which has been Social Plastic since mid-2020. In June 2020, the Beauty Care brand Fa launched the Beach Love limited edition, with product bottles made from 98 percent recycled plastic collected from beaches and the countryside. The QR code on the back of the bottle can be used to get more information about Plastic Banks work. In addition, the relaunch of our Nature Box brand is also supporting further steps in Henkels collaboration with Plastic Bank. Nature Box is the first beauty brand to introduce Social Plastic as a packaging material for its complete bottle portfolio, and all Nature Box bottle bodies are made of 98 percent Social Plastic. In 2020, Henkel Beauty Care also launched a limited edition of Schauma Meerestraum. The bottle bodies for these two liquid shampoos are made from 96 percent recycled plastic, half of which is Social Plastic. New packaging concepts Our EasyD4R software tool for evaluating the recyclability of packaging Recyclable packaging is a prerequisite for a functioning circular economy. In order to quickly and reliably determine the recyclability of new packaging, Henkel has developed the software tool EasyD4R. The tool is based on public and recognized sets of criteria, such as fabric softeners, dishwashing liquids or shampoos and shower gels in these stores. The gas station system was designed so that the customer selects an empty bottle of the required product when they enter the store, and they then scan its code at the station. A label is also printed to inform the customer of the products expiry date. When the product is used up, the customer takes the empty bottle back to refill it. The detergents and dishwashing liquid of the new Laundry & Home Care brand Love Nature can also be refilled. In selected stores of several drugstore and supermarket chains, Mein Spulmittel and Mein Waschmittel can be filled and easily refilled again and again. This makes Love Nature the first detergent and cleaning brand to offer this service across all retailers in Germany. In addition, the bottle bodies are made of 100 percent recycled plastic and can be fully recycled. In November 2020, the Beauty Care Professional brand Authentic Beauty Concept launched the first vegan refill bar on the European market. First the stylist provides a personal, professional consultation about the clients hair routine and wishes, and then recommends the right Authentic Beauty Concept product. As a second step, the stylist uses the refill bar to fill a bottle made from 92 percent recycled plastic with the required product. Once the client has used it all up at home, the empty bottle can be brought back to the salon to be refilled. This new process prolongs the life of single-use bottles, cutting plastic consumption and encouraging a circular economy. The new Love Nature brand offers refill stations for special bottles that can be refilled. There are two types of detergent and two dishwashing liquids to choose from. The three solid items are packed in the box without any additional packaging. Using naked solid items means that no additional material is used to wrap each item inside the box. The outer box also saves packaging material. The boxes are made of 100 percent FSC-certified paper and they are ready for shipping, eliminating the need for secondary packaging from Amazon. N.A.E. solid item box Henkels natural cosmetics brand, N.A.E., launched an eCommerce pilot project in cooperation with Amazon. Through reduced packaging materials and optimized supply chain processes, the brand underscores its commitment to sustainability. Another pilot project is the limited edition Persil Eco Power Bars. These compact detergent bars require fewer resources for production and transport. They also reduce packaging waste compared to other detergents. In addition, the packaging is made of recycled and recyclable cardboard. Persil Eco Power Bars are an example of how we use new packaging concepts in the eCommerce sector and take consumer feedback into consideration. Henkel invests in chemical recycling In 2019, Henkel and the packaging manufacturer Alpla jointly produced bottle bodies based on chemically recycled plastic for the first time. Plastic waste that is not recycled by mechanical recycling can be returned to the cycle through chemical recycling. In certain cases, chemical recycling can be used alongside mechanical recycling. By using chemical recycling, material made from fossil resources can be replaced by recycled material made from plastic waste. The pilot project using Perwoll bottles is part of BASFs ChemCycling project. ChemCycling uses thermochemical processes to convert plastic waste into pyrolysis oil. This secondary raw material can then be used in the chemical industry. A possible application is the production of plastic, for example for packaging. The packaging made from these chemically recycled materials has the same quality as packaging based on virgin plastic. This reduces waste and also decreases the amount of fossil raw materials that are used, which is important because these materials often cannot be recycled mechanically for a variety of reasons such as heavy contamination or lack of sortability. Henkel continues to switch to recyclable black plastic packaging For many years, black plastic packaging posed a challenge to the recycling value chain due to the colorant that was previously used to make it black. This is because recycling facilities use near infrared technology (NIR) to identify the packaging to be recycled. Optical sensors use the reflection of light to detect the material and sort it accordingly. However, due to the colorant, black plastic packaging cannot be correctly detected and sorted by these optical sensors. Together with its supplier Ampacet, a global masterbatch producer, Henkel worked on an innovative solution for black plastic packaging that is fully recyclable. The new packaging material uses an alternative black colorant that is carbon-free, so that bottles can be returned to the value chain after use. The Cyclos-HTP Institute, which specializes in classifying, assessing and certifying the recyclability of packaging and products, has confirmed that Henkels bottles, in black color and carbon-free, are fully detectable and sortable. After introducing its first recyclable black plastic packaging in 2019, Henkel took another step forward in 2020. Since the relaunch of Henkels hair care brand Syoss in September, the brands iconic black packaging has been fully recyclable due to the innovative carbon-free colorant. Additionally, all shampoo bottles are made of 98 percent recycled material (excluding the cap). Henkel also improved the black bottle of the Renew & Repair variant of Perwoll in 2020. An alternative, carbon-free colorant is also used for this packaging material, so the recyclable bottles can be reintegrated into the value chain. This makes the black bottles recyclable. They also contain 25 percent recycled PE. Digital watermarks promote high-quality recycling of packaging One of the most pressing challenges facing the circular economy for packaging is better sorting of consumer waste through accurate identification of packaging. This would enable more efficient recycling  and higher quality. Digital watermarks can help in this respect. These are inconspicuous, postage stamp-size codes that are applied to the surface of consumer product packaging. They can contain a wide range of markings, such as information about the manufacturer, processed plastics and the composition of multilayer items. The aim is to capture and decode the digital watermark using a high-resolution camera attached to the waste sorting system. Depending on the marking that is picked up, the system can then sort the packaging waste into the appropriate categories of material. This would lead to better and more accurately sorted flows of waste, as well as higher quality recycled material, which would benefit the entire value chain. Apart from serving as a digital recycling passport, digital watermarks have applications in other areas, such as customer loyalty, supply chain visibility, and retail. Since September 2020, Henkel has been one of more than 85 companies and organizations in the new HolyGrail 2.0 initiative, which is a pioneering initiative for digital watermarks for better recycling of packaging. The initiative covers the entire value chain and was set up by the European brand association AIM. Its purpose is to examine whether innovative digital technology can contribute to better sorting and higher-quality recycling for packaging in the EU, and in this way to promote the circular economy. Following the first HolyGrail project, which was led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the next phase, HolyGrail 2.0, is now being implemented on a much larger scale and scope. This includes commissioning an industrial test facility to determine how effective watermarking technology is in delivering Vernel Henkel is part of the new HolyGrail 2.0 initiative, making it a pioneer in digital watermarks for better recycling of packaging. Digital watermarks are inconspicuous, postage stamp-size codes that are applied to the surface of consumer product packaging. more accurate sorting of packaging waste and higher quality recycling. It also involves conducting a large-scale assessment of the business viability of this technology. Henkel is using digital watermarking technology as a pilot project in a new product line for its fabric softener brand Vernel. Packaging examples Our goal is to include materials from sustainable sources into smart designs for our product packaging, in order to close the loop. Packaging developers from our three business units are working on this. Moisture absorbers made from recycled plastic In 2020, Henkel launched its range of moisture absorbers under the well-known UniBond AERO 360 brand. UniBond AERO 360 is the first moisture absorber on the market made from recycled plastic. 60 percent of the unit, including the hood and overflow protection Recyclable toothpaste tubes Bottles for Pro Nature products made from Henkel is switching its entire tube portfolio 100 percent recycled plastic for dental care products to fully recyclable All PET bottle bodies for Pro Nature cleaning tubes from its packaging partner Albea by the products under the Biff, Pril and Sidolin beginning of 2021. In addition, the unique brands are made from 100 percent recycled tube manufacturing technology uses single-plastic, of which 50 percent is Social Plastic. layer blown film, which also reduces the carbon footprint of the products. system, is made of post-consumer plastic. In addition to using recycled colorants that are made from 100 percent recycled material. The fully materials in production, the new packaging is made of 100 percent recyclable aluminum tubes can be largely recycled through existing recycled cardboard. As well as that, both the unit itself and the main waste disposal systems. Henkel will also gradually switch the caps of packaging materials are designed for recyclability. Refill fragrances its tubes to recycled plastic. This is particularly important in view of are also available to allow reuse. the sorting process for aluminum-based consumer packaging: plastic components that are still attached to the aluminum packaging are Recycled aluminum tubes for hair colorants generally not recycled and are not returned to the cycle as valuable While plastic packaging is often the focus at present, we continue to high-quality recycling material. Aluminum can be recycled as often drive innovation and sustainability across all materials and pack-as required, without any loss of quality and without losing its aging types. In 2020, Henkel introduced aluminum tubes for hair mechanical properties. As a result, it is ideally suited for a functioning circular economy due to its durability. Around 75 percent of the larly highly, by combining high-quality packaging with a positive aluminum ever produced worldwide can still be found today in a wide range of applications. Aluminum has high recycling rates worldwide, but the availability of recycled material is limited due to high demand in several industries. The material is also used to make beverage cans, for example. contribution to the environment. This weight-reduced combination helps save up to 40 percent plastic compared to the previous packaging. By using 50 percent recycled plastic, the amount of virgin material needed is cut by half. In November 2020, Henkel Italy was recognized by Federchimica, the national association of the chemical industry, in the category Development and Use of Sustainable Packaging at the Responsible Care awards ceremony. Henkel Italy switched the previously white packaging for its dishwashing brand Nelsen to fully transparent packaging. This optimizes recyclability and supports the circular economy. The new bottle means that more than 600 metric tons of PET can be recycled in Italy each year. Henkel and Plastic Bank also received the Dow Packaging Award in 2020. The award is recognition of our packaging solutions using Social Plastic and our collaboration with Plastic Bank, which promotes a circular economy and campaigns against waste in the environment. In February 2020, the Social Plastic Lighthouse editions of Fa Meeresliebe shower gel and Nature Box Meeresgluck shampoo received the Global Leadership Award from the Packaging Consortium in New York City, USA. The Henkel assessment tool EasyD4R makes an important contribution to developing sustainable packaging solutions and promoting a circular economy. This was also recognized externally in 2020, with Henkel winning the Best Practice sustainability award from Pack<BR>aging Europe. Creating awareness of recycling Henkel South Korea collaborated with a local artist in South Korea who created a three-dimensional Jindo dog from empty black Loctite bottles. The Jindo is the national animal of Korea, representing strength and loyalty. The work met with a positive response, while also providing the public with an opportunity to find out about the use of plastic waste and plastic recycling. Other locations also continued to raise awareness about waste in the environment. In 2019, Henkel launched the global employee initiative Trashfighter: all around the world, more than 1,300 Henkel employees have taken part in collection campaigns and removed waste from riverbanks, parks and cities. These collection campaigns will be held again in the future. Investments for a circular economy The circular economy is becoming increasingly significant for investors and the financial markets. In January 2019, Henkel invested in the Circularity European Growth Fund I LP, an impact fund managed by Circularity Capital. This investment of 5 million pounds sterling enables Henkel to drive its venturing activities forward while also supporting the development of a circular economy. Circularity Capital invests in companies at different stages of development that are operating in the circular economy and that have a proven business model and strong value creation potential. In this form, the fund is intended to create value for all three Henkel businesses  for the Beauty Care and Laundry & Home Care business units on the consumer side, and for the Adhesive Technologies business unit in the advanced materials section. The fund provides access to an efficient network and a significant European pipeline of small and mediumsized enterprises that are enabling a circular economy. In 2019, Henkel also invested in the US cleaning agent start-up Trumans, based 124 125 This approach begins with the strong focus that we place on our own suppliers. For example, we regularly meet our strategic suppliers to review their contribution to our sustainability targets  as well as their impact on the key challenges facing the industries we operate in. We also present a sustainability award to one of our suppliers each year. In 2020, we presented it to Clariant, a specialty chemicals company headquartered in Switzerland. Clariant made an outstanding contribution to sustainability in 2020, particularly related to develop<BR>ing solutions with health and safety benefits. The strong partnership between Henkel and Clariant was characterized by open dialog with a focus on sustainable innovations. Enabling our customers to cut their footprint Alongside this focus on our own suppliers, we strive to be an outstanding supplier for our customers around the world. In recent years, many of our customers have defined ambitious targets to cut the carbon footprint of their products, use more renewable energy and prioritize sustainable suppliers. These targets are part of the global response to our planets rising temperature and the increasing pressure on its resources. New platforms like the Science Based Target initiative are encouraging companies to make public commitments to cutting emissions, while far-reaching legislation like the Green Deal for the European Union are setting a clear path for transformation. At Henkel Adhesive Technologies, our solutions and expertise are helping our customers to tap into opportunities generated by this transformation and to minimize the environmental impact of their business activities. In addition, our solutions help to save resources during the logistics phase of the value chain. Our hotmelt adhesives are used to secure goods to pallets and keep the goods safe as they travel from the manufacturer to the retailer. By switching to our hotmelts instead of industry standard approaches, our customers are able to reduce their use of plastic wrapping foil and shrink film by up to 90 percent, while also eliminating layers of anti-slip materials that are often difficult to recycle. Our hotmelts for securing boxes to pallets are even available in an auto-feedable format that increases safety and can improve efficiency by enabling automation. Products and technologies from our adhesives business unit also contribute to sustainability when our customers products have left the factory and are performing their intended function. Our solutions for data servers are a strong example of this. Trends like next-generation mobile internet connectivity or rising demand for video streaming are creating challenges for the servers that store and process the worlds data. These servers generate more heat when they operate faster for longer, and this heat has a negative impact on performance. Our solutions are able to significantly lower the operating temperature within a data server, which cuts energy consumption and extends the lifetime of the servers  while also enabling digital technologies that are contributing to sustainability in every area of our lives. Accelerating the transition to a circular economy Our pioneering solutions help customers across industries to promote the transition to a circular economy  where energy and materials stay within the economic cycle for longer and nothing is wasted. This concept is gaining a lot of attention from the media and the public, particularly related to plastic pollution. However, circularity goes far beyond consumer plastic: It is about completely transforming the way we think about resources, and turning waste and emissions into a valuable raw material. We use our game-changing technologies to accelerate this mindset shift and bring the circular economy to life. As always, this begins with the raw materials we use and designs we create for our own products. In 2020, our team of innovators joined forces with the global packaging manufacturer Berry Global to develop the first ever moisture absorber that includes recycled plastic. Our UniBond AERO 360 is made from 60 percent post-consumer recycled plastic, which saves 257 tons of virgin plastic and 269 tons of CO2 per year. On top of this, the packaging is made of 100 percent recycled cardboard. The device and the packaging are both specifi cally designed to be compatible with recycling processes. We also use our leading expertise to anticipate regulatory changes before they happen  and support our customers in developing circular innovations that will meet or exceed those regulations. Single-use plastic straws, for example, are the focus of increasingly strict legislation. Our Aquence ST range of adhesives is enabling the switch to paper straws as a more sustainable alternative. Industry standard paper straws are made of three layers of paper with a thin layer of our adhesive between each layer. Our adhesives make it possible for paper straws to withstand immersion in liquid for a longer period of time, and tests have confirmed that the paper straw packaging is biodegradable, which contributes to circularity by eliminating waste. Our focus to promoting a circular mindset was a key factor in the development of our EPIX technology. This platform extends the functionality of paper by increasing its impact resistance, ther<BR>mal insulation and other properties. This makes it possible to use paper instead of plastic for a wide range of products. During 2020, we collaborated with leading online retailers to launch a new pad<BR>ded mailer that keeps material in the economic cycle because it is compatible with conventional paper recycling systems. The mailer has received certification from initiatives including How2Recycle in the US and On-Pack Recycling Label (OPRL) in the UK. It also offers improved impact protection, so products arrive safely. While we use our leading expertise to develop high-impact innovations, we also share that expertise with partners from across industries and around the globe. In 2020, we hosted the Henkel Packaging Adhesives Sustainability Forum, a virtual conference where we provided insights into how to make progress toward sustainability for packaging. Almost 2,000 participants from more than 700 companies attended the two-day event, including representatives from every stage in the value chain  from raw material suppliers through to packaging producers and converters, brand owners and recyclers. The conference also provided a platform to showcase collaborative activities that are setting new standards for this industry. Packaging Adhesives Sustainability Forum Almost 2,000 representatives from every stage in the packaging value chain attended the Henkel Packaging Adhesives Sustainability Forum in 2020. This virtual conference aimed to share expertise and promote progress toward more sustainable packaging. Enhancing human health and safety At all times, we are absolutely dedicated to ensuring safety for everybody in our value chain, from our suppliers through to our own production teams, our customers and the consumers who use the final product. In this spirit, we test and assess our raw materials and finished products throughout the entire product lifecycle to make sure they meet the highest standards. Of course, our customers share our commitment to health and safety  and their focus is being sharpened by regulatory changes that aim to protect consumers. A new chemical strategy for sustainability, for example, is expected to be included within the Green Deal in the European Union. Adapting our product formulas is just one of the ways that we seek to enhance safety and help our customers to exceed regulatory requirements. Our Loctite 2400 threadlocker is not required to display any hazard symbols, risk statements or safety-related warnings on the packaging because it does not contain any substances of concern. The threadlocker makes a further contribution to safety by securing screws, nuts and bolts on machinery, which also extends the lifetime of the machinery by eliminating damage and failures. Our focus on enhancing safety continues to make an important impact even after our solutions have been applied. Our Polycryl FR coating for protecting building facades against moisture and damp, for example, has been awarded a Class A rating in line with the ASTM International standard E84. This confirms that it achieves the best possible performance in terms of preventing the spread of flames and the development of smoke. The product also contributes to sustainability because it is low in Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). By offering safety and environmental benefits that go beyond its core intended purpose, Polycryl FR is a strong example of how our innovators consider every aspect of safety and environmental compatibility throughout the entire product life cycle. Driving social progress Alongside our activities that address environmental challenges, we also promote social progress around the world by working together with communities and partners. In 2020, our employees stepped up these activities to support the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our collaboration to develop an innovative smart health patch is just one example. We joined forces with six medical and technol<BR>ogy companies to create the device, which is used to monitor the patients breathing, heart rate and temperature. Our teams created the electrodes and conductive inks for the smart health patch, which is now being used to treat people with COVID-19 in Belgium. The patch uses a sensor to automatically collect information about the patients vital signs. This data is then sent to a cloud via a wireless internet connection, and doctors and nurses can access it on a user<BR>friendly platform. This makes it possible for healthcare professionals to monitor their patients remotely, which saves valuable time and reduces the risk of infection by minimizing close contact. 133 134 In 2019, we launched N.A.E. (Naturale Antica Erboristeria), a natural cosmetics brand certified by ECOCERT in compliance with the COSMOS standard for organic cosmetics. Nature Box has also carried the ECOCERT cosmetics label since September 2020, proving that it meets COSMOS-NATURAL standards. This certification confirms that all Nature Box products are made with at least 98 percent ingredients of natural origin (including water  calculation in accordance with ISO standard). We have also had two of our production sites certified in line with the COSMOS standard. Product and packaging examples New care and styling series ACT NOW! ACT NOW! is the latest care and styling series from our Beauty Care Professional hairdressing brand Indola. With its compact product range consisting of twelve products, it is committed to more sustainability in everyday salon life. The formulas are vegan, free from silicones, parabens and artificial colors, and contain nature-based ingredients such as chia seed extract, almond oil and shea butter. The bottle and jar bodies in the ACT NOW! product series are made of up to 97 percent recycled plastic and are recyclable. The use of recycled material saves 9.7 metric tons of new plastic from fossil sources each year. In addition, ACT NOW! supports the work of Plastic Bank, which aims to stop plastic pollution from entering the oceans. ACT NOW! In addition to product-related sustainability aspects, ACT NOW! also aims to raise awareness of more sustainable ways of working in hairdressing salons. In the Sustainable Salon Series, episodes of which can be seen on the Indola IGTV channel, hairdressers share tips for how to make salon life more sustainable. Working together with consumers Our goal is to increase quality of life for as many people as possible, within the limits of available resources. By providing hair, skin and tooth care, our products also make a social and emotional contribution to quality of life. In parallel, life cycle analyses have shown that more than 90 percent of the water and energy consumption of our rinse-off products occurs during use. This is why Beauty Care uses its brands to inform customers and consumers about the sustainable use of products and to give them suggestions for how to use resources responsibly. In 2016, Beauty Care launched the Be smarter. initiative. Information on the product packaging, as well as an informative website and additional measures at the point of sale, explain how consumers can contribute to conserving resources. The first phase of the initiative focused on water as a resource, as well as on the energy-intensive process of generating hot water, within the context of our Be smarter. Save water. campaign. In a typical household, more than 70 percent of all hot water is used for showering. This means a change in behavior while showering can have a significant impact. In the second phase, we expanded the initiative to include recycling, focusing primarily on the responsible handling of packaging and how to dispose of it in a manner that conserves resources. To draw attention to these urgent issues, we launched the Be smarter. Recycle. campaign. Consumers are informed and made more aware about the correct approach to waste, as well as the recyclability of different types of packaging. In this way, we want to raise consumer awareness of the concept of a circular economy. The Be smarter. initiative now includes 25 brands and more than 100 countries. It also targets consumers in countries where the collection and recycling systems for packaging are much less developed than in Germany, for example. With the Be smarter. initiative, the Beauty Care business unit encourages consumers to save water and handle waste in a way that supports a circular economy. Partnerships for sustainable packaging solutions For many years, our Beauty Care business unit has been focused on innovations that contribute to sustainable development. Together with our partners, we develop solutions along the value chain. Promoting a circular economy is an important issue, for example. To this end, we work closely with various packaging suppliers. In 2014, Henkel launched the worlds first aerosol cans containing 25 percent recycled aluminum for deodorant sprays under the Fa brand, as a result of a joint development project with packaging supplier Ball Corporation. Since mid-2020, we have been using 100 percent recycled material in our aluminum tubes for hair colorants for various retail and professional brands such as Diadem. This enables Henkel to promote the circular economy while substantially reducing the ecological footprint of our packaging. Additionally, in 2020 we started to switch our entire tube portfolio for dental care products to fully recyclable tubes from the packaging supplier Albea. This switch will be completed at the beginning of 2021. Due to their multi-layered construction, conventional toothpaste tubes pose a challenge for high-quality recycling of materials. The introduction of Albeas Greenleaf technology will enable us to switch more than 700 metric tons of packaging material that can be recycled and repro cessed by existing waste recycling systems. An alternative, carbon free colorant developed together with our supplier Ampacet has been used in the new black packaging material for our Syoss brand shampoos since September 2020. This makes the bottles detectable, sortable and recyclable in recycling facilities. Additionally, all shampoo bottle bodies are made of 98 percent recycled material. As part of a major relaunch of the Schwarzkopf brand Gliss Kur, Henkel increased the proportion of recycled material across the entire product range. The new PE bottles for shampoo and conditioner are made of 30 percent recycled content, while the PET bottles for shampoo and Express Repair Conditioner consist of 97 percent recycled material. All bottle bodies are fully recyclable. In addition, the reduced use of metal foil simplifies the entire recycling process. The new black caps are made of carbon-free material, which means that they are recyclable as well. We have been trialing refill stations for hand soap, shampoos and shower gels in selected drugstores in the Czech Republic since 2019. In addition, we have been providing hair care refill stations for the Authentic Beauty Concept brand in selected hair salons across Europe since October 2020. The aim is to gain experience in the trial salons in order to roll out more refilling solutions in the coming years. Brand engagement Beauty Care has the vision of improving peoples lives worldwide and contributing to social progress above and beyond its products. This is why Schwarzkopf launched the Million Chances initiative in 2016. Its goal is to support girls and women worldwide in building a successful future for themselves. To do so, we had set ourselves the milestone of reaching a total of 140,000 girls and women with our projects and activities under the umbrella of the Million Chances initiative by the end of 2020. We have reached almost 130,000 women since the initiative was launched, by cooperating with international charities and through the voluntary commitment of our employees. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated restrictions, it was unfortunately not possible for us to achieve the set target by the end of 2020. The Million Chances initiative provides support for young adults entering the job market, for example. As part of the Employment prospects in the technological sector for young adults project launched in China in cooperation with Plan International in 2020, more than 600 people will receive comprehensive vocational training over the next two years. This project follows on from the successfully completed engagement in the Shaanxi region, where Schwarzkopf and Plan International implemented initiatives to improve employment prospects for young adults from 2018 to 2020. Through a project conducted in cooperation with Plan International, participants gain access to vocational qualifications and the opportunity to determine the course of their own lives. Photo:  Plan International The project participants, who come from poor backgrounds and are between the ages of 16 and 29, are offered a vocational qualification in high-demand areas such as programming, digital production design, photography and film editing. With the appropriate education, job application training and subsequent employment opportunities, they gain economic independence, and conventional gender roles are also broken down. Third Schwarzkopf Million Chances Award presented In November 2020, we presented the Schwarzkopf Million Chances Award for the third time. It honored non-profit projects for their outstanding commitment to supporting girls and women. Initiatives and projects from Germany, Austria and Switzerland that engaged in providing health care, education, economic emancipation or rights, and integration activities for girls and women were eligible to apply. The award was presented in the following categories:  Projects in the Build Up category support girls of elementary school age. In 2020, this prize went to the non-profit organization CLIMB GmbH.  Move Up initiatives support young women in gaining the best possible entry into employment. The award for this went to AMICA e.V. in 2020.  Projects in the Start Up category support women in making a new start into their professional or private lives. In 2020, KARO e.V. was the winner in this category. As in previous years, the winner of the fourth award was decided through a public voting process, with the award going to the GrunderMutter initiative. Each winning project received a cash prize of 10,000 euros, made possible by the Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation. Working together to reduce plastic waste in the oceans Our strategic partnership with the social enterprise Plastic Bank, which we initiated in 2017, aims to reduce the amount of plastic waste that enters the oceans while also creating new opportunities for people living in poverty. The local population in Haiti receives money, goods or services in exchange for the collected plastic. In addition to opening several collection points, Henkel has assisted Plastic Bank over the past three years in setting up a supply chain to recycle the collected plastic waste and reintegrate it into the value chain as Social Plastic. In 2018, the Beauty Care and Laundry & Home Care business units launched their first ever products with packaging made of 100 percent recycled plastic, including some Social Plastic. We have received several awards for this initiative, including one in 2020 from the PAC Packaging Consortium in the Packaging Innovation category. In the same year we received the Diamond Award, the highest honor bestowed by the American company Dow Chemical. In 2020, we integrated Social Plastic into other packaging of special editions, such as Fa Beach Love, and as a packaging material for the entire bottle portfolio of our Nature Box natural cosmetics brand. The bottle bodies are made of 98 percent plastic collected from the beach and countryside. Henkel is currently working to replace the remain<BR>ing 2 percent virgin plastic, which are based on the bottles color, with the recycled material as well. For that, we are already testing a color carrier consisting of Social Plastic. Nature Boxs commitment to sustainability earned the brands shower care portfolio the Explorer of the Year award from Swiss branded goods association Promarca in December 2020, which recognized the most noteworthy innovation of the year. Changing lives through hairdressing Another long-term project that is designed to help young people around the world secure a better future is Shaping Futures, which supplements the Schwarzkopf Million Chances initiative. For ten years now, Schwarzkopf Professional and non-profit organizations have offered young people the opportunity to obtain training in basic hairdressing techniques to establish livelihoods. Having started in Cambodia in 2010, Shaping Futures has since expanded to countries such as Croatia, India, the Philippines, Slovenia and South Africa. Since the initiative was launched, the voluntary commitment of almost 400 hairdressers has enabled more than 2,500 young adults to be trained in over 30 countries. After completing the training, more than 50 percent of them moved on to practical training, apprenticeships or job placements in the hairdressing profession. 144 145 market for less than three years. This includes products from the Pro Nature brand, which are notable for their particularly high proportion of ingredients based on renewable raw materials. Henkel has been using ingredients based on renewable raw materials for decades. In 2020, around 42 percent of the organic ingredients in our laundry detergents and household cleaners were derived from renewable raw materials. The remaining portion is divided into inorganic and petroleum-based components. Product and packaging examples Innovations in the detergent segment Our liquid laundry detergents show that outstanding washing performance can go hand-in-hand with sustainability. They are the result of several years of research and development, as well as significant investment in new product formulations, new bottles and new production processes. The liquid laundry detergents that were introduced in 2018 from our Persil, Spee and Weier Riese brands offer up to 40 percent more stain removal power per drop of detergent, for example. Our product development process placed particular focus on stain removal at low temperatures. This enables consumers to achieve excellent results when washing their laundry at low temperatures, and even when using cold water. In addition to improved washing power, our liquid detergents make an important contribution to the reduction of our footprint along the entire value chain. We save plastic in the production of the bottles, in comparison with the previous generation of bottles. Thanks to the more concentrated formula and a water-efficient production process, we use less water per year. In addition, we save of CO2 during the transport of our new generation of liquid laundry detergents, reducing truck trips. After use, the more compact bottles generate less plastic waste. The empty bottles are fully recyclable and can be introduced into the recycling process via disposal systems. Persil Discs were introduced in 2019, and feature a 4-chamber system that provides optimal washing performance for stain removal, brightness, fiber care and fresh fragrance in a single product. The gels in the four chambers remain protected until the foil dissolves on contact with water, which then releases the full power of the gels during the washing process  even at washing temperatures as low as 20 degrees Celsius. When the washing machine is loaded correctly, Persil Discs prevent excessive quantities of detergent from being used. The water-soluble packaging film is biodegradable. All universal and color variants of Persil have been available with the new Deep Clean Technology since 2019. There is also a new version of our Persil gel that combats unpleasant odors: Deep Clean Technology provides thorough laundry cleaning because the innovative formula with a special enzyme mix removes particularly deep-seated dirt and stubborn stains. An innovative odor-neutralizing technology was introduced in 2020. The improved Persil Discs now prevent odors during the wash and also while the clothes are being worn. We received the World Packaging Organisations Green Packaging Award 2020, together with packaging manufacturer Greiner Packaging, for the packaging of Persil 4in1 Discs with 50 percent recycled Polypropylene (PP). Persil Green Power is another innovation. 85 percent of the formulation consists of nature-based ingredients. The packaging contains 50 percent recycled material and the bottle is fully recyclable. The sealing and dosage cap were also redesigned to use less plastic. The product is certified by the independent German eco-label The Blue Angel. The limited edition Persil Eco Power Bars are an innovative product featuring a particularly compact shape. As a result, Persil Eco Power Bars require less resources for production and transport, and they also reduce packaging waste compared to other detergents. In addition, the packaging is made of recycled and recyclable cardboard. Persil Eco Power Bars are an example of how we use new sales channels in the eCommerce sector and take consumer feedback into consideration. Our new Love Nature product range Love Nature is the first brand of the recently established company, Love Nature GmbH. It is a wholly-owned Henkel subsidiary and belongs to the Laundry & Home Care business unit. Love Nature offers high-performance plant-based products for laundry, dishwashing and cleaning, with attractive fragrances and pleasant colors. The products have been extensively tested and certified for their environmental and skin compatibility. They bear the EU Ecolabel, in most cases are certified with the ECARF seal as skin-friendly and allergy-friendly, and contain only hypoallergenic fragrances. All Love Nature products are made without ingredients of animal origin. Through the Leaping Bunny certification, we also guarantee more stringent animal welfare standards than those required by law. The bottle bodies are made of 100 percent recycled plastic and can be fully recycled. The new Love Nature detergents, Universal Cactus Leaves and Color Cherry Blossom, are plant-based. They release their cleaning power at washing temperatures as low as 20 degrees Celsius, which helps to save resources. The two hand dishwashing products, Verbena and Cherry Blossom, use a sugar-based cleaning agent that works powerfully on grease to ensure sparkling clean dishes. Sugar-based detergents help to bind dirt and grease. Fragrance-free Love Nature all-in-1 dishwasher tabs use the salt of citric acid and the power of washing soda. The cleaning agent, rinse aid and water softener are already included. The folding box is made of recycled cardboard and can be disposed of as waste paper. The all-purpose cleaner and the bath cleaner are plant-based, like all other Love Nature products. The Love Nature bath cleaner can be applied either directly with a sponge or with a spray attachment that is sold separately and can be reused. Mein Spulmittel and Mein Waschmittel are also available for refilling at Love Nature refill stations. Love Nature The new Love Nature range offers high-performance plant-based products for laundry, dishwashing and cleaning that have won awards for their environmental compatibility. Expansion of the Pro Nature product range Pro Nature added two cleaning products to its range in 2020, Somat All-in-1 dishwasher tabs and Biff WC Total cleaning gel. Pro Nature products help consumers to clean responsibly and sustainably. Like the existing products in the Pro Nature range, the new Somat and Biff products have been certified by the independent Blue Angel eco-label. Pro Natures Somat All-in-1 dishwasher tabs are made from 94 percent natural ingredients and contain no fragrances at all. The packaging can be recycled and is made of recycled FSC-certified cardboard. The tabs are individually wrapped in a water-soluble biodegradable foil. 90 percent of the ingredients in Pro Natures Biff WC Total cleaning gel are of natural origin. Biff WC Total cleaning gels stick to the toilet throughout the cleaning process and combat dirt effectively, from the rim to deep below the water surface. All PET bottle bodies for Pro Nature cleaning products under the Biff, Pril and Sidolin brands are made from 100 percent recycled plastic, including up to 50 percent Social Plastic, depending on the product. Vernel Naturals fabric softener Henkel has launched its first fabric softeners based on a vegan formula and 99 percent nature-based ingredients, without silicones or colorants. The ingredients for the perfume are obtained from sustainable sources. The bottle bodies are 100 percent recyclable and made from 100 percent recycled plastic, 25 percent of which is Social Plastic. In Germany, Henkel uses watermark technology in two Vernel products. This will help to improve sorting, bringing the circular economy a step nearer. Pril hand disinfectant gel Washing hands and regular disinfection are among the main pillars in the fight to contain COVID-19. To meet the increasing consumer demand for disinfectants, Henkel has added a product specifically designed for hand hygiene to its range. Pril disinfectant gel removes 99.9 percent of bacteria and specific viruses, without the need to add soap or water. It is ideal for everyday use at home or in the workplace. The pump-action dispenser enables doses to be measured out easily, while the skin-friendly formula of the disinfectant gel does not dry out the hands. Pril disinfectant gel Pril disinfectant gel removes 99.9 percent of bacteria and specific viruses, without the need to add soap or water. Product logos support consumers Henkel aims to promote sustainable behavior among consumers. We want to motivate consumers to adopt the most sustainable washing habits possible. For this reason, we have developed a logo with the slogan be sustainable  wash cold. In addition, Henkel has developed new product logos that show the proportion of recycled content and how recyclable the packaging is. The PET bottles for many of the spray bottles and fabric softeners from our Vernel brand are made from 100 percent recycled material. They are surrounded by a sleeve, which is a type of film covering. The advantage of this thin film sleeve is that it covers the bottle, which can take on a yellow to grayish appearance due to its high volume of recycled content. The film is also customizable, so that the bottle itself does not need to be colored and can be recycled very easily. When the contents of the bottle are used up, the film must be separated from the bottle so that the bottle can be recycled. To make this process easier for consumers, Henkel has developed a product logo with a zipper, and the film cover is perforated. This important aid to recycling-friendly disposal can already be found on many products from our Vernel and Silan brands, as well as our spray bottles and toilet cleaners from the brands Biff, Sidolin and Bref. Perwoll bottles with 25 percent recycled material Henkel has made progress this year in PET recycling, and also in packaging made of PE (polyethylene). Since 2020, Perwoll bottles in Western Europe have been fully recyclable, and they also contain 25 percent recycled PE as standard. This is recycled plastic from end-consumer households. Packaging with 25 percent recycled material Perwoll bottles in Western Europe are fully recyclable and contain recycled PE from end-consumer households. Assessment of the recyclability of packaging In 2020, 89 percent of our Laundry & Home Care consumer packaging was recyclable. Recyclable packaging is a prerequisite for a functioning circular economy. In order to quickly and reliably determine the recyclability of new packaging, Henkel uses its specially developed software tool EasyD4R. This is based on public and recognized criteria catalogs and is used by Henkel throughout the company. The goal is to quickly and accurately assess the recyclability of packaging as early as the first stages of product development. The functional efficiency of the tool has been confirmed by an independent test conducted by the Fraunhofer Institute for Environmental, Safety and Energy Technology (UMSICHT). The scientists analyzed the evaluation software and its results, and compared them with national as well as international standards. The latest version of the evaluation tool, released in 2020, enables packaging developers to also analyze packaging made of paper or cardboard, as well as glass, aluminum, or tinplate. This involved integrating design guidelines created by the University of Applied Sciences, FH Campus Vienna, along with the German minimum standard for packaging. Brand engagement Working together to reduce plastic waste in the oceans Henkel was the first global consumer goods company to enter into a partnership with the social enterprise Plastic Bank in 2017. Our joint goal is to reduce plastic waste in the oceans while providing new opportunities for people in poverty. As part of the partnership, a total of five plastic collection centers have been built in Haiti. Locals drop off collected plastic waste and exchange it for money or social benefits. A part of this plastic waste then becomes Social Plastic, and is fed into the recycling value chain and made available for use in product packaging from Henkel. Henkels first product packaging with Social Plastic was launched in October 2018. Since the summer of 2019, all PET bottle bodies of Pro Nature cleaners from the brands Biff, Pril and Sidolin, as well as bottles of the fabric softener Vernel, have been made of 100 percent recycled plastic. Since mid-2020, they have also included up to 50 percent Social Plastic. A total of around 560 tons of collected Social Plastic was processed for Henkel in 2020, ensuring that this plastic reenters the value chain and does not end up in the ocean. Somat and Pril support UNICEF in the fight against malnutrition In many regions throughout the world, children do not receive the utrition they need for healthy development. Only one in six children in low-income and lower-medium-income countries receive nutrition that meets minimum requirements. UNICEF works to provide children, families and communities with access to healthy and nutritious meals through its global nutrition programs. Somat and Pril have been contributing to UNICEFs global nutrition programs as part of the #enjoytogether initiative since 2019. As many as 14 million contributions to healthy meals were made in 2019. Consumers were able to continue supporting the initiative directly in 2020 by purchasing participating products from the two brands. In Germany, packs of Somat and Pril with different labels were available  with a contribution made to a healthy meal for each participating product purchased. Support for families in need During the COVID-19 pandemic, Laundry & Home Care employees helped to support families in need in Lebanon and Jordan by distributing boxes of Persil products, so that people could stay at home. Country-wide brand initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic In 2020, Laundry & Home Care continued to make a social contribution by distributing free laundry detergents and household cleaners or food in poorer regions. A total of 3.5 million consumer units were donated. The business unit also entered into partnerships with local NGOs. Together with the Blida organization and the Pril brand, food packages were sent to families in need in Algeria that have faced a particularly heavy impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of more than 100,000 people were reached through this activity. In Algeria, Henkel also helped to improve hygiene with its cleaning brand Bref. A total of 50,000 liters of Bref were distributed to hospitals, 10,000 protective masks were issued, and more than 250 gel dispensers for hand disinfectant were installed. Laundry & Home Care also partnered with two NGOs in Lebanon and Jordan, Banin and Hashemite, to help people in need. As part of the From our heart to the heart of your home initiative, Henkel employees packed and delivered Persil product packages, supporting over 13,000 households. Perwoll raising awareness in fashion consumption The frequent consumption of fast fashion is increasingly having a negative impact on the environment. For example, clothing is often worn only seven times before it is discarded  bearing in mind that there are up to 24 new fashion collections every year. Through the #RethinkFashion initiative, Perwoll has been promoting awareness of this issue since 2019. Using targeted communication, the brand encourages consumers to adopt a more responsible attitude to buying fashion items, through cherishing, appreciating and caring for clothing. Two new seals have been available since 2020: A logo with a blue background continues to appear on products manufactured by a company that is a member of the initiative of A.I.S.E., while the Industry Sustainability Seal with a green background identifies products that meet special criteria. Since 2020, packaging requirements have also applied to the Detergents category in order for a product to receive the new Industry Sustainability Seal. These requirements expand on existing criteria such as the environmental safety of the ingredients, resource efficiency in terms of quantities used and volume of packaging materials, washing performance at low temperatures, and consumer information. For example, Plastic packaging must now be recyclable, reusable or compostable. Cardboard packaging must be recyclable and contain at least 70 percent recycled material or be 100 percent sustainably sourced. In 2020, a new safety pictogram was introduced on the packaging of our liquid laundry detergent capsules. This pictogram was developed in 2019 to expand the voluntary initiative A.I.S.E. Product Stewardship Programme for Liquid Laundry Detergent Capsules. It features a photo of a toddler to more effectively indicate that liquid detergent capsules must always be kept out of the reach of children. The pictogram also refers to the following website, which is available in all EU languages: www.keepcapsfromkids.eu. This website explains how liquid detergent capsules can be safely stored and used. Henkel continues to support the online educational initiative Keep Caps from Kids, which provides information about why it is so important to keep liquid detergent capsules away from children. 156 157 Employees who like to study on their own and have access to a PC are able to complete the online training program at the time that suits them best. Alternatively, we provide numerous group training sessions for employees who prefer to study in groups, as well as for employees without access to a PC. We provide the necessary training material in more than 30 different languages to overcome potential language barriers and facilitate access to training. All of the training courses end with a questionnaire, after which the participants receive a certificate. However, qualifying as a Sustainability Ambassador is only the first step: We encourage all ambassadors to use their skills and knowledge to make their own contributions and actively engage in sustainability. Developing employees to unleash their potential It is our aspiration to create an appreciative working environment where all employees can develop and excel at Henkel in the longterm, and where they can give their best. To do so, we foster their skills and knowledge, and help them to reach their full potential. Regular and open feedback about performance and potential serves as a foundation for their development. As a result, individual development measures can be defined that address both the companys needs and each employees potential. To meet our employees needs even more specifically, we have further expanded the range of digital learning material we offer. We are also strengthening the development of digital skills, so we can successfully leverage the opportunities presented by digitalization. and personal goals. Since 2018, the training platform has also been accessible on all mobile devices. This accommodates employees who are on the road a lot, and has also proven useful when more people are working from home. At the beginning of 2021, we will also introduce our own training app, through which all learning content will be available. IT security has become more important than ever, not least due to increased mobile working of many employees in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the risk of cyber attacks is now particularly high. Raising employee awareness is one of the most important measures that companies can take to protect themselves against cyber attacks. To this end, Henkel launched a cyber awareness campaign in 2019 under the motto #SharedResponsibility. The campaign is based on three strategic pillars: inform, educate and engage. As part of this campaign, a multi-day cyber-awareness fair was held for the second time at our Dusseldorf location at the start of 2020, and was broadcast to a number of countries. Local information was also provided at other locations. This made it possible for more than 5,000 employees worldwide to participate in the trade fair. Digital working has gained importance Mobile working has become everyday routine during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has accelerated the digitalization of the world of work and demonstrated the importance of digital collaboration for business continuity. Digital solutions help us to learn from each other and also enable us to work together efficiently and engage in quick and personal interaction in a virtual environment. The companywide use of a digital collaboration, communication and videoconferencing platform is an example. This enabled us to respond optimally to the changing work requirements of 2020 and to maintain the collaboration of our employees, despite being located in separate places. We also use digital communication channels to promote knowledge transfer throughout the company. One example of this is our social network Yammer, which is used to exchange views in subject-specific groups and to inspire each other. By enabling employees from a wide range of departments to contact each other, we can reinforce interdisciplinary thinking and better exploit our existing knowledge potential. In searching for the best talent, we use digital channels to showcase what makes Henkel an attractive employer. In 2020, we increased our presence at virtual industry trade fairs and on social media. Using these media, our employees provide insights into their daily work and development at Henkel under #MyStory@ Henkel and #JobOfTheMonth. Through the #AskMeAnything format, we give people the opportunity to ask career-related questions directly to top managers and experts at Henkel. We also greatly expanded the digitalization of our processes in 2020. Our new recruitment platform simplifies, improves and accelerates processes for everyone involved, whether its the simple, multimedia application process or increased transparency for the departments involved in the hiring process. We enable flexible working At Henkel, we measure performance by results and not by presence. This is why we have been promoting flexible working models for many years. Based on a culture of trust, part-time work, flexible working hours, new workplace concepts and mobile working are a natural part of our work  and not just since the COVID-19 pandemic. Being able to work wherever and whenever necessary, regardless of time or place, improves the work-life balance. The trust we place in our people strengthens their motivation. Our managers are instructed to put opportunities for flexible working into practice and to support them actively. By signing our global Work-Life Flexibility Charter in 2012, the Management Board has been emphasizing the importance of this topic at Henkel for many years. We always assess the performance of our employees in the context of our vision and corporate values. We are committed to leadership in sustainability  this is one of our five corporate values. Accordingly, contributions to Henkels sustainability strategy and to its targets form part of the comprehensive annual performance assess<BR>ment, which influences variable compensation. Where specific aspects of our sustainability performance, such as the reduction of energy use and waste volumes, fall within the sphere of influence of the employee concerned and have a clear bearing on business performance (as in the case of site managers), these are included in the individual performance assessment of this employee. In addition, almost every manager has to confirm compliance with the Henkel standards in writing during their annual review. These include our Code of Corporate Sustainability, the SHE Standards, and Social Standards. Our employee share plan We believe it is important for our employees to share in the success of our business. This improves motivation, as well as the strength of identification with the organization. Since 2001, Henkel has offered an employee share plan. The intention of this is to align the interests of the company and those of our employees even more closely, while giving employees an attractive opportunity to provide individually for their future investment and their retirement. For each euro invested in 2020 by an employee (limited to 4 percent of salary up to a maximum of 4,992 per year), Henkel added 33 eurocents. Around 12,400 employees in 58 countries purchased Henkel preferred shares under this program in 2020. At year-end, around 17,500 employees held a total of around 2.7 million shares in the programs securities accounts, representing 1.5 percent of total preferred shares outstanding. The lock-up period for newly acquired shares is three years.

In countries where no state social insurance system exists or such a system covers only basic needs, we organize our own measures and initiatives to supplement state health and pension insurance provisions. In the USA, for example, we cover our employees almost completely with private health insurance plans. In addition, in many countries where this is usual market practice, Henkel provides company pension provision plans. We want to encourage our employees to think more about their health and act early by giving them access to optimal prevention. In cooperation with the Allianz Insurance Group, we have been offer ing all of our employees in Germany the opportunity to have selected preventive health check-ups as private patients since 2017, with a free choice of doctor and without any contribution to the costs. In 2019, we expanded the existing range of social benefits by adding the supplementary corporate long-term care insurance Henkel Care- Flex. It was developed together with the Industrial Union for Mining, Chemicals and Energy. In this way, Henkel is able to offer all of its approximately 9,000 employees and trainees in Germany a basic insurance for outpatient, inpatient and semi-inpatient care. The insurance is available without a medical examination and waiting period. In addition to the basic insurance, employees can add the supplementary long-term care insurance and can also add family members, such as partners, children, parents or parents-in-law. My Henkel Bike is another part of our extensive range of additional benefits. All employees who have a permanent employment contract at our sites in Germany have been able to lease up to two bicycles on attractive conditions as part of a deferred compensation plan. In this program, Henkel is working together with the provider mein-dienstrad.de. The offer also includes fully comprehensive insurance and a full service package with maintenance and repair, for which Henkel bears the costs. Besides the new company bicycles, Henkel also promotes car-sharing in partnership with Share Now, and provides tickets for local public transport. or through live broadcast. At our Dusseldorf site, we took German Dialog through diversity networks Diversity Day as an opportunity to further raise the diversity awareness of all employees. Alongside the opportunity to address the issue in a fun way through an online game, the day was celebrated with a panel discussion that was broadcast throughout Germany. In 2020, Henkel established a global diversity network that works closely with our Corporate Diversity and Inclusion team. This network consists of selected managers, known as Diversity Change Leaders, who set their own priorities in their business units, functions and regions, and who initiate specific changes to develop diversity within their areas of responsibility. We encourage our employees to form networks. At present, there are almost 30 diversity-related employee networks worldwide on a range of issues such as gender, origin or sexual orientation. They are an important and welcome part of our corporate culture. Within the networks, the employees gain co-determination freedom in their areas of interest. For example, the Henkel Black Alliance, an employee group dedicated to strengthening the African-American community within Henkel, compiled a collection of video material in 2020. These videos aim to throw light on ethnic diversity and discrimination, unconscious bias, and the Black Lives Matter movement. Our networks are cross-functional across all business units. They provide a platform for exchanging opinions and sharing experience, offering advice and mentoring, and making new contacts. Our diversity dimensions At Henkel, we pursue a holistic approach to diversity and inclusion, which includes individual personal characteristics as well as experience, knowledge, and skills. We promote diversity in all relevant dimensions in order to develop the full potential of our employees.  Gender: Our goal is to continually increase the share of female representation at all levels of the organization. For this, it is critical that we create the required framework conditions that permit our employees to balance the planning of their career and their personal life. In 2020, the proportion of women in management positions was around 37 percent. We have various support programs for women in our business units and functions worldwide. In the Beauty Care business unit, for example, a global, internal network called RISE was created to promote gender balance in management positions. Women can take part in a structured year-long virtual mentoring program as part of the network, providing them with the opportunity to share ideas and receive advice from more experienced managers. Regular webinars with internal and external experts are also part of RISE. The aim of the Women into Science and Engineering program, run by the Adhesive Technologies business unit, is to connect women at various management levels with managers in the technology and engineering sector worldwide to enable the sharing of skills and knowledge. Even outside our own company, we are addressing the underrepresentation of women in technical professions and driving forward gender diversity in the startup and technology sector. Our digital unit and platform for open innovation and collaboration, Henkel dx Ventures, hosted the Xathon for the second time in 2020, an ideation hackathon for more than 70 female founders. The event aims to empower female tech talents to develop and shape their entrepreneurial mindset and ideas.  Cultures: An international workforce composed of people with different cultural backgrounds is important in a global company like Henkel, as it enables us to develop an understanding of our markets. In order to meet the challenges of mixed teams, we provide intercultural training courses and workshops. These aim to increase awareness of different value systems and their influence on our daily behavior. Henkel also encourages international transfers within employees career paths. The experience gathered opens up new ways of thinking and perspectives. With employees from a total of 125 countries, cultural diversity is a part of everyday working life at Henkel. Employees from 73 different nations work at the company headquarters in Dusseldorf alone. Semi-retirement at Henkel With three models for semi-retirement, we want to actively shape the demographic change at Henkel. These models target shift workers, specialists, and employees within our factories, laboratories and administrative teams. This enables our employees at all sites in Germany to leave work up to six years early, depending on the semi-retirement model. This provides particularly important support for employees in demanding shift work. At the same time, we encourage the targeted training of qualified young people by having their experienced colleagues in semi-retirement coach them in direct preparation for a specific role. This ensures that we keep many years of knowledge within Henkel and the companys future viability is strengthened.  Generations: We encourage life-long learning across all generations through appropriate training measures. Specifically, we use mentoring and employee networks in different business units and countries to promote knowledge transfer and an exchange of perspectives between experienced and less experienced employees. We also offer our employees a wide range of programs for maintaining health.  LGBTQ+: Henkel strives to create a working environment that is open to all people regardless of their sexual orientation or identity. We have LGBTQ+ networks in several countries and raise awareness of the issue through a range of events and activities. LGBTQ+ stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and other sexual orientations. During the Pride Month in June 2020, we expressed our solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community by placing the rainbow flag behind our corporate logo on global social media channels. Our Beauty Care brand got2b also launched a limited Pride Edition of two products. 10,000 euros of the proceeds from these special editions were donated to Trans*beratung Dusseldorf. This organization provides professional psychosocial and socio-legal counseling on all issues related to transsexuality and gender identity. Open communication and trust-based collaboration Our employees are our greatest asset  this is deeply rooted in our strategy and values. In an increasingly challenging world, companies need a solid foundation as well as the flexibility to react to a changing environment quickly. A successful management culture must be founded on an environment of trust that is open to ideas and innovations, and that enables decisions to be made. By introducing the new Leadership Commitments at the beginning of 2019, we have already started to change the way we work together on a daily basis. Our goal is to establish a corporate culture in which employees show entrepreneurial spirit and initiative, think proactively, put team spirit into practice and take responsibility  no matter whether they lead a team or not. We set up a new Leadership Commitments communication platform in 2020. With a clear focus on collaboration and a new range of facilities for workshops, learning and reflection, we actively support cultural change at Henkel on a long-term basis and make this accessible to all employees. The aim is to make the Leadership Commitments our cultural norm. Our Leadership Commitments provide an opportunity to challenge and enhance our corporate culture. To obtain a clear picture of the status quo and identify strengths and potential improvements, we also conducted a comprehensive employee survey, the Organizational Health Index (OHI). Around 10,000 employees worldwide were invited to take part in this anonymous survey with the aim of providing open and honest feedback. Based on the results, which indicate a good overall score for Henkels corporate health, we have defined clear fields of action and next steps for 2021. regular visits and training. In several regions, locally employed First sickbays Since as far back as 1910, nurses have been tending to the health of workers in sickbays that were initially set up as medical care facilities. In July 1940, the companys Corporate Health Services was officially introduced with a staff of three company doctors. In order to ensure holistic healthcare at all sites, we work continuously to establish uniform principles. These now include the availability of first responders, the offer of flu shots and participation in the global health campaign, as well as conducting emergency medical drills and occupational health screenings. An important step in 2014 was the introduction of global key figures for health protection, which we updated and expanded in 2019. These key figures are reported annually by all Henkel sites worldwide. In addition, the sites report occupational diseases as soon as they have been officially confirmed by the authorities. The Health Procedure, introduced in 2015, describes the minimum global standards for protecting and promoting health. In the implementation of internal guidelines, programs and legal requirements, regional managers for health, workplace safety and security provide support for each site as the first point of contact, as well as during doctors also act as health managers, helping our employees by using their specialist knowledge and familiarity with the local conditions and the local language. In designing these programs, our sites determine different priorities based on local requirements. Our fifth global health campaign Protect Your Life 2020 Even in 2019, our annual global health campaign was focused on the prevention of infectious diseases. In Protect Your Life, our company doctors provided comprehensive information about hygiene such as regular hand washing and sneezing etiquette, and about preventive measures, especially vaccinations. Due to the global spread of COVID-19, we continued the campaign in 2020, focusing on integrating preventive measures into our employees daily lives and on the annual flu vaccination. The measures included a new podcast format in which the company medical service provided information about corona myths, medicines and vaccines. An eLearning course on social distancing, safety and hygiene measures was also developed. This and other information about the services provided by our Corporate Health Organization was made available on a globally accessible platform and actively communicated on all channels. With this approach, Protect Your Life 2020 was able to reach more than 90 percent of our employees. Occupational safety is our top priority 2020 was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Henkel introduced stringent preventive measures at an early stage to do our part in containing the coronavirus and safeguarding the health of our employees. For example, employees whose duties allow them to work from home have been encouraged to do so until further notice. To improve work-life flexibility, they were offered the opportunity to make their working hours even more flexible, where feasible. In the case of employees whose business-critical duties required their presence at our sites, we took rigorous protective measures to ensure a safe working environment. These included modified workflows, social distancing regulations, personal protective equipment and the provision of hand disinfectants. However, occupational safety within the company and along the value chain was a top priority for us even before the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain focused on our long-term objective of zero accidents and want to improve our occupational safety by 60 percent by the end of 2025 compared to 2010. To this end, we are investing in training to raise awareness, as well as in measures to enhance technical safety. By the end of 2020, we wanted to reduce our worldwide occupational accident rate by 40 percent compared to the base year 2010. We significantly exceeded this milestone by the end of the year, as we reduced the accident rate by 50 percent per million hours worked. We regularly review whether our Safety, Health and Environ<BR>ment (SHE) standards are being strictly adhered to. We are also committed to improving occupational safety at our subcontractors and that of other companies employees working at our sites. Improved awareness of safety is a basic prerequisite for our employees to recognize and eliminate accident risks in the tasks they perform. Regular training courses are held at all sites to make employees aware of this and to teach them to behave safely. In addition, we are increasingly leveraging synergies across our business units for this purpose and are extending the programs already established in some units across the entire company. Since 2017, we have also been planning company-wide global safety campaigns that target increased awareness about the most important safety issues. How we protect employees and strive for more occupational safety The Adhesive Technologies business unit has been concentrating on rolling out its Culture Based Safety (CBS) program globally since 2015. The core element is open dialog about safe and unsafe behavior in everyday work in order to avoid incidents. The focus here is on mutual encouragement to develop a safety culture, as well as on constructive feedback about unsafe behavior. 180 181 Supporting corporate volunteering Since the foundation of the initiative MIT Volunteering (Make an Impact on Tomorrow) in 1998, we have supported the voluntary activities of Henkel employees and pensioners in over 16,000 projects and more than 100 countries around the world. At the same time, more and more employees and pensioners are joining forces to implement larger social projects. Better equipment for the St. Martinus Day Care Center In 2020, the MIT initiative once again supported the friends association of the St. Martinus Day Care Center in Grevenbroich near Dusseldorf, Germany. Henkel employee Lisa de Vegt has been a volunteer in the association since 2018. The donation was used for purposes including purchasing new childrens vehicles and implementing projects such as a new research week. From left to right: Ole Driesen, Lasse de Vegt and Jenke Sell conduct research on Swimming  Floating  Sinking. The St. Martinus Day Care Center has been a member of the non-profit foundation Haus der kleinen Forscher (Little Scientists House) since 2011. The foundation is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Working with social initiatives for more equality Through our involvement in social partnerships, we support social initiatives and public institutions at Henkel sites around the world. The main objective is to promote education and equal opportunities in cooperation with the Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation. Building blocks for a good quality of life Since 2017, Henkel and the Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation have been supporting Fondo Unido in Mexico and Guatemala, and United Way U.S.A. These are two local organizations under the umbrella of United Way Worldwide, which is committed to promoting the common good in communities around the world. The focus is on education, financial stability and health, which are the building blocks for good quality of life. Henkel employees like David Alvarez and Edys Contreras regularly get involved in United Way programs for local communities. Making a smooth transition into the workplace Since 2012, Henkel and the Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation have been the main supporters of the non-profit educational initiative Teach First Deutschland, which encourages young adults to achieve a better school-leaving certificate. At Teach First Deutschland, university graduates support schools in disadvantaged communities. As additional teachers, they help students to find their own path and reach their full potential. Beyond Germany, Henkel also supported the Teach for All organi<BR> zation in Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, India, Latvia, Ukraine, the USA and Vietnam in 2020. Our brands engagement In addition to Henkels social engagement on a corporate level, our brands are also involved in partnerships with social initiatives and public institutions around the world. Schwarzkopf Million Chances initiative Since 2016, the Schwarzkopf Million Chances initiative has been supporting girls and women in becoming more self-confident and building a successful future for themselves. The initiative supports aid projects worldwide, often in cooperation with independent organizations such as Plan International Deutschland e.V. in Colombia, Egypt and China. In 2020, around 4,600 women and girls were reached by 14 projects. The third Schwarzkopf Million Chances Award was presented in 2020, sponsored by the Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation. It honored four non-profit projects for their outstanding commitment to supporting girls and women. The umbrella of our Million Chances initiative also covers our longterm initiative Shaping Futures. Since 2010, Schwarzkopf Professional and SOS Childrens Village have been offering young people the opportunity to obtain training in basic hairdressing techniques and establish livelihoods. More than 2,500 young people in 30 countries have already been trained thanks to the volunteer work of hairdressers and employees. Fast and unbureaucratic emergency aid Henkel takes a fast and unbureaucratic approach to providing aid after natural disasters worldwide through the Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation. Contribution to combating the COVID-19 pandemic In 2020, Henkel launched a comprehensive global solidarity pro-gram to support employees, customers and affected communities in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the program, Henkel donated two million euros to different funds and organizations. The Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation donated one million euros from this amount directly to the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations (UN) Foundation. This donation helped to provide protective equipment for frontline health workers, equip diagnostic laboratories, improve data collection and analysis, establish and maintain intensive care units as well as to accelerate research and development of potential vaccines and therapeutics. The remaining one million euros from our overall donation of two million euros was distributed by the Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation to different organizations and partners worldwide, and also supported Henkel employees with their personal commitments and voluntary engagement in fighting the crisis. In addition, Henkel also donated five million units of personal and household hygiene products globally. Henkel produced 111,000 liters of disinfectant worldwide and donated it to hospitals and public institutions in Algeria, Colombia, Germany, and Mexico. 186 187 Our people engage with a wide range of stakeholder groups All of our employees worldwide are encouraged to be engaged in their working environment and to base their decisions on the principles of sustainable development. For many of our employees, this includes regular dialog with stakeholders, where experts at our various company sites and in our different business units engage in discussion with relevant stakeholder groups on specific local and regional challenges. This allows us to develop customized concepts and solutions that can be implemented and assessed effectively. In 2020, as in each year, Henkel employees met with politicians, scientists and scholars, businesspeople and members of the public. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, considerably more events were held in virtual formats than in previous years to protect the participants. Sustainable packaging and the circular economy were key topics of discussion at many stakeholder dialog events in 2020. To underscore our commitment in this area, Henkel is a founding member of an initiative focusing on plastic waste, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW). Close to 50 international companies along the value chain for plastics and consumer goods have joined forces to tackle the global challenge of a circular economy together. The aim of the alliance is to promote solutions that put a stop to plastic waste entering the environment, especially in the oceans. Henkel is also involved in the Recyclate Forum initiated by German drugstore chain dm-drogerie markt. In addition, Henkel is a member of the New Plastics Economy (NPEC), an initiative led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation that brings key stakeholders together to rethink and reshape the future use of plastics and build momentum toward a circular economy. Henkel signed a Plastics Pact in this respect, in both the US and Europe. These two regional agreements, to which we were one of the first signatories, bring governments and businesses together to collaborate in moving toward a circular economy in which plastic is reused again and again. These topics were also the subject of various events in 2020. For example, Prof. Dr. Thomas Muller-Kirschbaum, Head of International Research and Development Laundry & Home Care, spoke at the SEPAWA Congress, a major meeting point for the European detergent and cleaning agent, cosmetics and perfumery industries. He discussed scenarios for a sustainable circular economy using plastics, but without fossil raw materials. Muller-Kirschbaum also participated in panel discussions, such as the World Ocean Summit Insight Hour organized by The Economist magazine, which focused on the avoidance of plastic waste. These discussions were held online, as was the Henkel Packaging Adhesives Sustainability Forum 2020, which was organized in this form for the first time. The packaging industry conference offered conference rooms, 16 exhibition stands and a networking lounge in virtual form, where the more than 1,000 participants could discuss a wide range of topics related to sustainable packaging solutions. Visitors to the virtual stand at the Henkel Packaging Adhesives Sustainability Forum were able to find out how our products contribute to more sustainable packaging solutions and a circular economy. The EcoVadis B2B Sustainability Forum also addressed the supply chain. More than 1,000 people took part, including some Henkel employees. In one of the presentations, Bertrand Conqueret, Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) at Henkel, spoke about the role of purchasing in sustainability strategies and how this function can best contribute to change. Henkel was also represented at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2020 in Davos by Carsten Knobel, CEO, and Sylvie Nicol, Executive Vice President Human Resources and Chair of the Sustainability Council. The global economic conference was held with the theme Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World. During the conference, Henkel was also admitted to the WEFs Global Light<BR>house Network. This honors the outstanding application of technol<BR>ogies from the fourth industrial revolution. Dr. Rajat Agarwal, President of Henkel China, spoke at the China Chemical Industry and Chemical Park Forum in Zhangzhou, China. He shared insights into how Henkel is working to further develop sustainable and value-adding production processes. He also gave recommendations for how the Chinese chemical industry can achieve sustainable growth in the future. Richard Yu, Head of Public Affairs & Governmental Relations at Henkel in China, also emphasized the potential for greater cooperation between different players within this industry. The event brought together almost 1,600 people from various organizations and roles. China Chemical Industry and Chemical Park Forum At a panel discussion during the China Chemical Industry and Chemical Park Forum, Dr. Rajat Agarwal, President of Henkel China, spoke about the sustainable development of the companys own production footprint and that of the entire chemical industry in China. Henkel UKs cooperation with The Guardian, a global media company, is another project that was successfully conducted for the fourth year running in 2020. The Sustainability Unwrapped series focused on plastics and packaging. The series was supplemented by The Sustainable Shelf campaign in 2020. This reported on a range of topics such as sustainable consumption and the Henkel solidarity program to support the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Sustainable development to combat climate change was the main topic discussed by representatives from Henkel Chile during the seminar Balance of COP25 Chile-Madrid: What is expected for 2020?, which was organized by ComunicarSe. During the seminar, Roberto Pavez, Head of Product Development for Consumers and Craftsmen at Henkel South & Latin America, highlighted our companys commitment to tackling climate change through a long-term, high-impact strategy. In his presentation, he dealt with the economic effects of the climate crisis. At the Open Eyes Economy Summit in Poland, Wiktoria Brauksiepe, Head of Finance Poland, spoke about future challenges and developments in non-financial reporting. Henkel published its first envi<BR>ronmental report as early as 1992. The topic is now gaining importance throughout the business world, as stakeholders are increasingly demanding more transparency. This also applies to investors. The importance of sustainability for corporate financing was also affirmed at the Private Equity Conference of the NRW.BANK in Germany. Ulla Huppe, Head of Sustainability in the Adhesive Technologies business unit, spoke about the changing demands of investors, and addressed the financial opportunities and risks of sustainability. CEO Carsten Knobel attended a live streaming event organized by the German newspaper, Handelsblatt. He spoke about some of the innovative sustainable finance projects that Henkel has been involved with since 2018. This includes the Green Loan, which is a loan linked to sustainability ratings. Another example is a plastic waste reduction bond, the proceeds of which will be exclusively used to finance projects that reduce or avoid plastic waste. The virtual event brought together high-ranking representatives from various organizations to discuss current challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. Viewers were able to get involved in the panel discussion by putting questions to the participants and taking part in voting activities. Henkel was again a partner of the German Sustainability Award in 2020 and took the opportunity to engage in panel discussions with stakeholders on German Sustainability Day. The largest conference on sustainability in Germany was held this year as a hybrid event, with a limited number of stakeholders physically present in Dusseldorf and about 2,500 online participants. Uwe Bergmann, Head of Sustainability Management, joined representatives from various industries to discuss whether sustainable investments could be a key driver for sustainable development. In a second round of discussions on the topic of Sustainability as a collective venture  Who if not everyone?, he and his fellow panelists debated how sustainable development can be achieved as a collective effort by politics, science and business. The German Sustainability Award is an initiative of the Stiftung Deutscher Nachhaltigkeitspreis e.V. in cooperation with the German Federal Government, the German Council for Sustainable Development, economic associations, local government associations, civil society organizations and research institutions. Dialog with politicians and government authorities Policymakers and government authorities often seek out the expertise of companies in their political decision-making processes. When requests are made from the political or regulatory environment, we are happy to provide our experience-based knowledge and to describe how political considerations impact Henkel, our employees, and our business partners. Our Public Affairs Standard  Representation of Interests in Public Affairs, is applicable worldwide, and lays down clear rules of conduct and regulations in this respect. As a company, we provide open information about our areas of interest and the scope of our political work, for example, through our entry in the European Unions (EU) transparency register. In addition, we see proactive communication and overall stakeholder dialog as an important tool, enabling our company to respond to upcoming changes in the regulatory or political environment at an early stage. This in turn is a basic requirement for good corporate governance (compliance) and is essential for our corporate planning. In this context, the concept of the European Green Deal is highly relevant to Henkel. An example of this is the presentation of the action plan for the circular economy by the European Commission in March 2020. Above all, this initiative specifically calls for the use of more recycled material in plastic packaging. For Henkel, this also leads to new requirements for the design of our consumer goods packaging, with the aim of further improving recyclability and helping to obtain more high-quality recycled material. Together with the Center for European Policy (CEP), Henkel conducted a study on the development of a circular economy for plastics in the EU. In summary, the CEP study highlighted a range of fields of action. Prominent examples include the development of an EU-wide recycling-oriented plastics industry for non-food packaging, the creation of the necessary framework conditions in the EU Member States for the collection of plastic waste, and the establishment of an EU internal market for plastic recycled material. Potential obstacles and different viewpoints require competent dialog in order to put the European Commissions political ambition into practice in a targeted manner. These instructive findings formed the basis of a webinar entitled Toolbox for success: How to boost the EUs circular plastics economy, which was organized by Henkel in November 2020 and was targeted at EU-level decision-makers. In this interactive event, the dialog Henkel is also a founding member of the Renewable Carbon Initiative. This aims to promote acceleration of the transition from fossil-based to renewable carbon for all organic chemicals and mate<BR>rials. In addition, Henkel joined the Amazon Climate Pledge. This international, cross-industry climate protection commitment was co-founded by the Amazon company and the non-governmen<BR>tal organization Global Optimism. Its members commit to measur<BR>ing and reducing emissions, and to achieving climate neutrality by 2040 at the latest. Supporting education for sustainable development At Henkel, we believe it is important to address issues of sustainable development beyond our own sphere of influence. In 2017, Dr. Christoph Henkel, and the Konrad-Henkel-Stiftung and Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundations, endowed the Chair for Sustain<BR>ability Management for Business Management at the Heinrich Heine University in Dusseldorf to mark the 25th anniversary of the Economics department. The aim of this endeavor is to contribute to meeting global challenges related to sustainability management by promoting teaching and cutting-edge international research in this field, with a particular focus on sustainable behavior. Since the winter semester of 2018, Prof. Dr. Rudiger Hahn has been the chair of the newly endowed Henkel professorship. His research and teaching activities focus on central issues of sustainability manage<BR>ment where they interface with traditional business management disciplines. Thanks to the endowed professorship, Henkel has fur<BR>ther strengthened its partnership with the Heinrich Heine Univer<BR>sity. The sponsors have endowed around 2 million euros, which will be provided over a period of ten years. 197 Sustainability ratings 2020 EcoVadis ISS ESG Sustainalytics Zurcher Kantonalbank Paris: As a member of the Together for Sustainability initiative, Henkels sustainability management was again assessed by the international rating agency EcoVadis. Henkel received the Platinum Recognition Level, which is the highest assessment category for this corporate social responsibility rating. Other assessments and rankings Carbon Disclosure Project London: Henkel has been participating in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) since 2004 to foster transparency in our markets and for our investors.

As such, Henkels place was confirmed in the sustainable investment universe of the ZKB, which forms the basis for various investment products offered by the Swiss cantonal banks. Indicators The indicators we record throughout the company provide transparency while helping us to identify potential improvements, manage activities and monitor achievements. We show the progress of each of our indicators over a five-year period. In this Sustainability Report, we focus on the publication of our globally relevant core indicators. The figures in the tables within this chapter have been rounded up or down. As a result, the rounded figures in some of the rows in the tables may not add up to the totals as indicated. Environmental indicators for our production operations The production-related data for 2020 were determined at all 179 Henkel sites in 57 countries. This means the data represent 100 percent of our production volume. The data were validated centrally for year-end reporting and verified at the sites within the framework of our internal audit program. Any differences discovered or reported at a later date are corrected retroactively in our reporting system. Since our production structures are constantly changing  due to the start-up of new sites or closure of existing sites, for example  the number of sites contributing data changes accordingly. To ensure the comparability of the annual data, we also show their progress as an index relative to the volume of production. Employee indicators Occupational accidents are registered using a globally uniform reporting system. 99 percent of Henkel employees were covered in 2020. In line with this, the published employee indicators also cover 99 percent of our employees.             214 Contacts Corporate Communications Phone: +49(0)211-797-3533 Email: corporate.communications@henkel.com Sustainability Management Phone: +49(0)211-797-3680 Email: sustainability@henkel.com Credits Published by Henkel AG&Co.

Schwarzkopfs Million Chances initiative was launched in 2016 to support women and girls in building a successful future for themselves. Part of the Million Chances initiative is the project Shaping Futures. Since 2010, Schwarzkopf Professional and SOS Childrens Village have been offering young people the opportunity to obtain training in basic hairdressing techniques to establish livelihoods. Volunteer teams from our partner salons share their knowledge and experience. Promoting sustainable palm oil We aim to support sustainable practices in the palm oil industry along the entire value chain. By supporting sustainable palm (kernel) oil, we contribute to sustainable forest management and prevent deforestation. Collaboration with representatives from across the industry is at the heart of our approach. We aim to increase the availability of sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil on the market, for example, through collaborative projects that enable smallholder farmers to certify their crops as sustainable, increase productivity and improve their livelihoods. Turning waste into opportunities We want to reduce the flow of waste into the oceans and contribute to protecting our oceans. Henkel was the first large global consumer goods company to enter into a partnership with the social enterprise Plastic Bank. As part of this partnership, three new plastic collection centers have been built in Haiti. The local population can return collected plastic to the collection centers and exchange it for money, goods or services. In this way, we generate value from plastic and stop it from entering our waterways or oceans, while also reducing plastic waste in the oceans and generating new opportunities for people in poverty. Promoting sustainable consumption We support the goal of promoting sustainable and resource-saving consumption. Our products and technologies are key to this because they are used in millions of households and industrial processes every day. We focus on developing products that lead to resource efficiency in every day use. We also strive to encourage responsible use of our products through targeted communication. This is important because the environmental footprint of many of our products is determined during the use phase. The Henkel footprint calculator helps individuals to calcu<BR>late their CO2 footprint. Doing laundry at lower temperatures also helps reduce energy use and CO2 emissions. Through continuous research and development partnerships and significant investment in new formulations, we enable our consumers to achieve excellent washing results when using increasingly concentrated dosages at lower temperatures  or even when washing laundry in cold water. We raise awareness of the need to save energy by placing the be sustainable  wash cold logo on our laundry detergent packaging to draw consumers attention to this topic. The potential for savings is enormous: If no water had to be heated for any of the loads of laundry washed with our heavy-duty detergents, it would be possible to avoid around 7,011,000 tons of CO2 emissions each year. Ceresit  building insulation Our external thermal insulation composite systems for building facades help to reduce energy consumption. In 2018, we contributed, for example, toward saving around 5,644,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions. The following nine examples show how our products and technologies help our customers and consumers reduce CO2 emissions. The evaluation of the contributions is based on a company-wide, standardized process that sets out the criteria for the selection of the products and the calculation in CO2 emissions. In the future, we plan to evaluate additional applications and further expand the portfolio of products that contribute to CO2 savings in the application phase. Somat dishwasher cleaner Dishwashers require regular cleaning to per-form properly. Somat dishwasher cleaner is the first product of its kind that can be used when the machine is fully loaded, saving time, water and energy.

They make their contributions to sustainable development in their daily business lives and also as members of society. This dedication unites the employees in our three business units, the regional and national societies, and our corporate functions. Our employees are actively committed to ensuring that our brands and technologies make significant contributions to environmental and social challenges. They are the interface to our customers and consumers. Working in areas such as sales, production and marketing, they are active along our value chain and collaborate with our partners. They make innovations possible, develop strategies and make our company unique. Because of this, we want to further develop and boost our peoples engagement in sustainability. Henkel initiated the Sustainability Ambassador program to encourage our employees to engage even more strongly with the topic of sustainability. Employees as Sustainability Ambassadors Since introduction of the Sustainability Ambassador program, Henkel has trained more than 50,000 Sustainability Ambassadors globally. We have expanded our training programs in recent years to anchor our understanding of sustainability even more firmly within the company, and to encourage all of our employees to become Sustainability Ambassadors. We reach our employees through an eLearning program on our central global learning platform, as well as through team training sessions that we organize worldwide using standardized training materials. In addition to discussing the fundamental principles of sustainability  from concept to key global challenges  the training program also explains how Henkel is responding to these challenges and implementing sustainability. and their enthusiasm to others around them. By the end of 2018, we The customers we reach with our brands and technologies are an had reached over 150,000 schoolchildren in 53 countries. important target group. Our Say yes! to the future initiative, for example, provides Henkel sales representatives from all businesses all around the world with training in sustainability topics that apply to sales, going beyond the content of the Sustainability Ambassador program. They then apply this knowledge in joint projects with our trade partners  in logistics, for example, or by promoting sustainable purchasing decisions. Above and beyond our existing programs, we also want to give our employees opportunities to engage in volunteer projects and make their own contribution to the communities in which we operate. We aim to reach 10 million people through our employees social engagement activities by 2020. These include our Building Trips, where our employees help build multi-family houses for people in need. Henkel supports this kind of engagement with in-kind donations, such as construction materials. Henkel is also the main supporter of the Teach First program. In this way, we support the engagement of university graduates and future leaders, who, as supplementary teachers, help schools and students in socially disadvantaged communities and social focus areas. 29 30 Our organization for sustainability Corporate functions Through their representatives, the corporate functions bring both their expertise and their needs to the Sustainability Council. At the same time, they support the implementation of our sustainability strategy in their respective functions. For example, they develop appropriate supplier management tools or systems for measuring greenhouse gas emissions. Overarching sustainability issues are coordinated by the Corporate Communications department, which serves as the company-wide interface for sustainability. 39 40 Binding supplier code Compliance with the cross-sector Code of Conduct of the German Association of Materials Management, Purchasing, and Logistics (BME) is mandatory for all of Henkels suppliers worldwide. Henkel joined the BME in 2009, as its code is based on the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact and can therefore be used internationally. The BME code also serves as the basis for contractual relationships with our strategic suppliers. This means that they have either recognized the cross-sector BME code  and hence the principles of the Global Compact  or produced their own comparable code of conduct. The BME code has already been translated into 12 languages. Henkel is a signatory to the crosssector Code of Conduct of the German Association of Materials Management, Purchasing, and Logistics (BME). Honoring our suppliers As part of our supplier management activities, we collaborate intensively with our strategic suppliers to ensure the procurement of sustainable raw materials. We aim to initiate positive change throughout the value chain through joint projects for process optimization, resource efficiency, and environmental and social standards. Furthermore, Henkel has been honoring sustainable innovations by its suppliers for six years. In 2018, the Adhesive Technologies business unit awarded the Sustainability Award to Covestro for its ongoing contribution to Henkels product and project pipeline. The two companies cooperate intensively to develop alternative technologies for health and safety and bio-based polyurethane raw materials, among other things. Covestro develops and produces sustainable raw materials that enable Henkel to expand its businesses. This includes applications that improve the migration properties of flexible packaging or that replace formaldehyde-based products in the timber construction market. 47 48 Driving efficiency In line with our aim to continuously improve our entire production network, we began introducing the Henkel Production System (HPS) in 2015. Through this Group-wide optimization program, we want to systematically identify and eliminate all inefficiencies, such as waiting times, excess production or defects from our value chain. This will enable us to contribute to our target of becoming 75 percent more efficient by 2020. We have set standards for the harmonization of production workflows that apply to all three business units. HPS is based on lean principles and on engaging all of our employees to ensure that they implement the new standards effectively, while saving resources. In this context, our Adhesive Technologies business unit, for example, has introduced a Best Operative Practice program. During sustainability workshops at the Henkel production sites that account for the majority of our operational footprint, examples of best practice for driving progress toward our environmental and safety targets were identified and shared with colleagues at other sites. In 2018, we conducted workshops for cross-functional teams at 13 Adhesive Technologies sites worldwide. An example of the implementation of efficiency programs at our Laundry & Home Care sites is the optimization of spray towers in laundry detergent production. Detergent powder is produced in spray towers by injecting moist detergent paste into the tower through nozzles, before converting the paste into dry powder with the help of a warm air flow. We have implemented several efficiency measures to operate the spray towers with as little energy as possible. These include a global tool for comparing energy usage, which helps detect the optimization potential for the respective systems. We also operate a heat recovery system and have improved the process step that involves injecting the detergent paste into the spray tower. Thanks to these measures it is possible to save 2,300 metric tons of CO2 annually. There is also a heat recovery system in place in the spray tower at our laundry detergent production site in Toluca, Mexico. This process improvement makes it possible to achieve a CO2 reduction and is part of a comprehensive on-site sustainability project aiming to reduce our carbon footprint that also includes optimization efforts related to our use of raw materials, as well as our formulas, packaging and logistics. In 2018, as in previous years, we were widely recognized for our efforts to make our production processes more efficient. Our Engels plant in the Saratov region in Russia, for example, was recognized by the regional Ministry for Industry and Energy as one of the best plants in the region because of the energy efficiency improvements that have been implemented there. Our plant in Vienna won the Klimaaktiv prize in 2017 and was presented with the EMAS certification during a special ceremony. EMAS stands for Eco-Management and Audit Scheme and is a voluntary European Union scheme. The recognition was presented to companies and organizations who demonstrated outstanding commitment to eco-management performance. Our Beauty Care sites also implemented energy efficiency measures. Our Tesistan plant in Mexico, for example, reduced energy consumption, cut the volume of wastewater generated and increased occupational safety through an optimized steam recovery system. It also implemented measures to reduce energy and gas consumption including automating the process for loading pallets, optimizing the allocation of packaging materials and changing the shift system. To increase awareness of resource efficiency, as well as the need to conserve energy and water while avoiding waste, the global SHE team (which stands for safety, health, and environment) conducted the Think sustainable, act responsible campaign. The campaign mainly targeted employees at office and research sites. New multi-technology production site in Turkey When building new plants, we aim to integrate our ambitions related to efficiency and renewable energy as early as the design phase. For example, we were able to achieve several large-scale projects supporting environmental compatibility and enabling the optimal use of renewable energy sources at our Gebkim site in Turkey, which commenced operations at the end of 2018. The site takes advantage of LED lighting that is supplemented with natural light, as well as a heatreflecting roof and efficient cooling systems that enable highly efficient operation of the production systems. It also features outdoor solar lighting. Heat pumps that combine geothermal heat and cooling are used to generate hot water for the administration building and offices. In addition to optimizing energy usage, we implemented efficiency measures related to water consumption and waste volume, including optimized wastewater treatment systems and a system for recovering up to 90 percent of condensation, as well as a process for recycling wooden pallets. The production building in Anatolia received a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) 58 When choosing our transport partners, we take efficiency as well as environmental and safety performance into account. Relevant criteria are included in our tendering processes for the purchase of logistics services. These include energy-saving targets and measures for modernizing vehicle fleets. Expanding intermodal transport Intermodal transport involves using more than one mode of transportation. At Henkel, this means that more and more transports are being switched from road to rail: A truck carries the goods to the nearest rail loading terminal. From there, the goods cover longer distances by train, before a second truck collects the goods at the destination terminal and delivers them to the customer. This allows us to make use of the lower CO2 footprint of rail transport compared to road transport, since a train emits about one-third of the CO2 of a truck when transporting the same weight of goods. For this reason, intermodal transport has become a key driver for CO2 reduction in logistics at Henkel. In 2018, we continued to leverage intermodal solutions and added another 15 train routes in Europe using dedicated intermodal tenders. By the end of the year, we had switched around 68 million tonne-km (the transport of one tonne of goods over a distance of one kilometer) to intermodal transport. This reduces CO2 emissions by around 3,700 metric tons per year. Major drivers are the Laundry & Home Care and Beauty Care business units, which switched 30 million and 38 million tonne-km respectively from truck to train. Improving our warehouse network We select the location of our warehouses and distribution centers to optimize the routes between our production sites and our customers. So-called wall-to-wall production, where the warehouse is directly connected to the production facility, minimize transport from production to storage. Where this is not the case, we achieve synergies by consolidating transports between individual plants and warehouses. We also make use of the mega warehouse concept, where a small group of main distribution centers store products until the required quantities are due for on-time delivery to regional warehouses and retailers. In 2018, our Laundry & Home Care business unit integrated the warehouse logistics from the Benelux countries into its fully automated high-bay warehouse at our headquarters in Dusseldorf, Germany. A detailed footprint study showed that delivering to Benelux from Dusseldorf involves transportation distances that are very similar to those when delivering from within Benelux. This means that we are able to ensure similar customer delivery times, while reducing the overall logistics footprint by around 5 percent per year. In line with the wall-to-wall concept, the high-bay warehouse is directly connected to the Laundry & Home Care production facility, which also cuts transport requirements. Several of the processes that take place inside the facility are automated: The pallets are brought into the warehouse by conveyor systems, and are identified by scanning before being put into storage. Orders from customers are communicated electronically and the relevant products are made available for onward transport by automated trolleys. The pallets can be tracked at every step of the journey until they are delivered to the customer. Electromobility in the vehicle fleet As a pioneer in sustainability, we encourage the use of electromobil-the public grid and between 120 and 180 grams per kilometer for a ity at our sites by testing the operational capability of electric vehicles conventional gasoline engine. We have also installed new solar before any new purchase. We take regional aspects and driving pro-technology in a facade of one of our site restaurants, which generates files into consideration. At our headquarters in Dusseldorf, we have carbon-neutral electricity. The amount generated in a year could be incorporated more than 30 electric vehicles into the internal fleet used for the carbon-neutral charging of over 700 electric vehicles, since 2012, replacing conventional vehicles with internal combus-equating to a distance driven of around 100,000 kilometers and a tion engines. We have built a corresponding infrastructure with over reduction in CO2 of around 14 metric tons. 35 charging stations in and around the Dusseldorf-Holthausen industrial park, some in cooperation with the utility company Stadtwerke Dusseldorf. In 2018, we also made 14 on-site charging stations available for our employees to recharge their private electric vehicles. Henkel has been using electric forklifts since the 1950s. Other projects to encourage electromobility include the use of cargo bicycles at company sites and adopting a new car policy that enables all managers in Germany who are entitled to a company car to order vehicles with electric drives. 64 65 Sustainability stewardship Our research and development If we are to decouple increased quality of life from resource use, product innovations will play an essential role. Our products therefore provide key leverage points for implementing our sustainability strategy. They should offer customers and consumers more value and better performance at a smaller environmental footprint. A high degree of innovativeness is very important in achieving this. In 2018, Henkel employed around 2,750 people on average in research and development and invested 485 million euros in these activities. In order to steer product development in line with our sustainability strategy from the outset, criteria for assessing sustainability have been systematically anchored in the Henkel innovation process since 2008. The focus is on innovations that will help our customers and consumers to reduce their energy use and thereby their own carbon footprint. Sustainability evaluation in the Henkel innovation process The Henkel focal areas have been systematically anchored into our innovation process since 2008. At a certain point in the process, our researchers must demonstrate the specific advantages of their project in regard to product performance, added value for customers and consumers, and social criteria (more value). They also have to show how it contributes to using less resources (reduced environmental footprint). One of the tools they use to assess the different contributions is the Henkel Sustainability#Master.  Sustainable consumption An important objective of our strategy is promoting sustainable consumption that conserves resources. Our products are the key here. They are used in millions of households and industrial processes every day. This is why we concentrate on developing products that enable the efficient use of resources such as energy and water during everyday use. Our aim is to save 50 million metric tons of CO2 emissions by 2020 through our products and by helping our customers and consumers with our expertise. Through targeted communication, we additionally strive to encourage responsible-minded behavior while using our products. This is especially important because the environmental footprint of many of our products is determined to a large extent during the use phase. Besides providing appropriate products, our collaboration with retailers and distributors also plays a crucial role. Every individual can contribute to more environmental compatibility through their behavior. The Henkel footprint calculator summarizes this in a vivid manner: By answering simple questions, consumers can quickly estimate how much CO2 they generate through their own lifestyle in the areas of living, nutrition, mobility and recreational activities. Trade partnerships Retailers are important partners for Henkel on the path to more sustainable consumption and provide us with excellent platforms for informing consumers about more sustainable products and encouraging them to use these products in an environmentally responsible way. In November 2018, Henkel and retailer dm-drogerie markt launched the fourth edition of the educational partnership Understanding through Experience. Over a period of several months, 21 Henkel trainees and dm apprentices will study the topic of sustainability intensively and develop independent projects in mixed teams. The educational partnership enables the trainees to look beyond their own horizons. Working together on joint projects, young people with different professional backgrounds can exchange ideas and develop their own awareness of the many facets of sustainability. In March 2019, the trainees and apprentices will present their projects in an exhibition. research in dermatology and cosmetics. The tissue models are pro duced in the research laboratories at Henkels headquarters in Dusseldorf. As an alternative test method, they can contribute significantly to reducing and avoiding animal testing. With its decision, Henkel is demonstrating its commitment to corporate social responsibility in enabling unrestricted long-term access to innovative alternative methods, thereby making an important contribution to the global use of alternative methods. Our scientists are currently working to make it possible for the skin models, which are as large as a 1-cent coin, to be used to research other issues regarding the safety of chemicals. You can also find more information on the website of the Scientific Committee on Con<BR>sumer Products of the European Commission. We have set three goals that we believe address key priorities for the successful transformation of the palm oil industry. These goals are focused on the specific challenges where we can make our strongest contribution. The targets for 2020 are: 1. Cover 100 percent of our demand with Mass Balance-certified oils: All palm oil and palm kernel oil used in our products should be derived from sustainably cultivated sources in line with the RSPOs Mass Balance model in 2020. To date, around 65 percent of the oil and derivatives used in our products have been certified according to this model. 2. Establish full traceability of palm oil and palm kernel oil used in our products: By the year 2020, we aim to be able to trace the palm oil, palm kernel oil and derivatives we buy to known sources  first to the mill and then to the plantation. We have made great progress in this respect. We have held discussions with all relevant suppliers focusing on how to reach our goals, and have stated our expectations clearly and comprehensively through related training materials. Since the requirements related to traceability and compliance with standards have continued to increase, we were not able to increase the traceability ratio in 2018 as much as we did in the previous year. However, we still managed to achieve a ratio of 60 percent in 2018. Initiative for more sustainable guar Guar and guar derivatives are important plant-based raw materials used in many cosmetic products. The new hair and body care brand Nature Box, which was introduced in July 2018, contains guar for hair and skin care purposes. Henkels Nature Box brand supports guar farmers in the desert region of Bikaner in Rajasthan, India. They learn sustainable guar farming methods and also receive valuable advice regarding the planting of their own vegetable gardens. All product formulas were developed so that they primarily consist of natural substances. Together with Solidaridad, Nature Box also supports the sustainable production of palm oil and palm kernel oil. Three areas that promote a circular economy 1. Materials from sustainable sources  Recover: In order to recover as much existing material as possible, Henkel constantly works on increasing the share of recycled content in its packaging. While many of our brands already offer products with packaging made from recycled material, we set ourselves the ambitious target to use 35 percent recycled plastic for all the plastic packaging of our consumer goods products in Europe by 2025. At the end of 2018, the share was almost 10 percent.  Renew: We also aim to continually increase our use of renewable materials. The most widely used packaging materials made from renewable raw materials are paper and cardboard. We target to use 100 percent recycled paper and cardboard material or, where necessary, fresh fiber originating from sustainable forestry to contribute to zero net deforestation, by 2020. This is also part of our commitment to the Consumer Goods Forum initiative against world<BR>wide deforestation and for the protection of biodiversity. Our paper-based packaging currently comprises more than 60 percent recycled paper and cardboard. In addition, we are testing and assessing bioplastics. The polymers of these materials are based on raw materials obtained from plant sources, such as cane sugar or maize. Provided they can deliver the same technical performance as conventional polymers, they could offer a good alternative and provide long-term economic benefits.  Remove: There are substances of potential concern, like polyvinyl chlorides (PVC), which are often criticized as packaging materials. Henkel began to remove and avoid the use of PVC in its packaging back in the 1990s. Today, we only use PVC in a few exceptional cases for which we have not yet found a workable alternative. Over all, materials containing PVC currently make up less than 1 percent of our total global expenditure on packaging. We continue to work toward our goal of fully eliminating PVC from our packaging materials and extend the scope to cover other substances of potential concern. 2. Smart packaging design  Reduce: Reducing packaging material or avoiding it completely is the best way to minimize waste and thus negative environmental effects. We aim to reduce the amount of packaging material where possible and do away with all packaging that is not absolutely essential. For many years, we have been striving to reduce the quantity of packaging material in the entire product life cycle without impacting the quality, performance, or safety of our products. We will continue to do so in the future. Thanks to a more concentrated formulation and a newly designed bottle for liquid laundry detergents such as Persil, Henkel was able to reduce the packaging volume by 3,500 metric tons annually. The bottles are fully recyclable.  Replace: Next to that, a smart design right from the start plays a vital role in order to replace virgin material with recycled or renewable alternatives where feasible and technically possible. For example, stability requirements can limit the use of alternative materials in some packaging. With smart designs for newly developed packaging, we are testing the possibility of using alternatives to virgin material if quality and quantities on the market allow for it.  Rethink: However, smart design goes beyond this. To transform a linear economy into a circular economy, our packaging experts even rethink packaging concepts to foster designs that enable recycling. They also further optimize transport packaging and related logistics, as well as assessing further ways to develop re-usable packaging that places a stronger focus on durability. 3. Closing the loop  We are aiming for 100 percent of our packaging to be recyclable,  Recycle: To enable a circular economy, we are striving to make sure our product packaging can be recycled after the product has been consumed. By systematically applying design-for-recycling principles, we want to overcome recycling hurdles specific to each category, like flexible packaging, sleeved or black packaging. At the same time, it is important that appropriate systems for recycling packaging materials are in place. That is why we partner with organizations from along the packaging value chain to drive progress in the infrastructure for recycling.  Reuse: Another option to close the loop is to reuse packaging and explore refill solutions in relevant markets based on consumer acceptance, the related expenditure and costs. We also want to maximize the re-usability of secondary and tertiary packaging that is typically used for shelf displays or logistical purposes.  Return: A third option that allows for circularity is the ability of specific packaging to be returned to nature under certain circumstances. This may, for example, include compostable plastics that are based on renewable raw materials, mineral-oil-based sources or a mixture of the two. However, the current compostable plastics do not yet meet the stringent requirements that we place on our packaging materials. Nevertheless, we closely follow developments in this sector and actively search for suitable materials and possible uses. If we use biodegradable materials, they will meet the international composting standards. reusable or compostable by 2025. At the end of 2018, we had achieved this for more than 80 percent of our packaging. We want people to be aware of how the circle can be closed and plan to reach more than 1 billion consumers with targeted information about recycling. At the same time, we will inform our employees worldwide about these matters. In March 2018, a Laundry & Home Care team collected plastic waste at the banks of the river Rhine in Dusseldorf, Germany. The activity was conducted as part of the partnership with Waste Free Oceans with the aim of removing plastic waste from our waterways. Partnerships to close the loop Progress toward sustainability in packaging will only be possible if organizations from all stages of the packaging value chain work together. Henkels experts are engaged in several cross-industry initiatives to drive innovation in packaging development and to find effective solutions that can be developed on a large scale. Henkel has also teamed up with different organizations that are working on improving recycling infrastructure to enable a circular economy. Appropriate systems for recycling packaging materials are not in place in many areas, especially in developing countries. We believe that partnerships along the value chain are the only way we can make sure our product packaging can be recycled or reused after the product has been consumed. Social partnership to transform waste into opportunities The Plastic Bank is a social enterprise that aims to stop plastic pollution in the oceans and provide opportunities for people in pov<BR>erty at the same time. Henkel started working with Plastic Bank in 2017, and was the first major global consumer goods company to partner with the organization and successfully incorporate the plas<BR>tic collected into some of its product packaging. Since the beginning of the partnership, three new plastic collection centers were estab<BR>lished in Haiti, a country that lacks sufficient waste management infrastructure. The local communities can return collected plastic waste and exchange it for money, goods, or social services. In this way, value is created from plastic and it is prevented from entering the waterways and oceans. By the end of 2018, a total of around 63 metric tons of plastic had been collected, sorted and subsequently introduced into the recycling value chain as Social Plastic. This is a verification of the material by the Plastic Bank, which indicates that the collectors received an above-market price for the plastic waste. The recycled Social Plastic can be used in products or packaging, and in this way closes the material cycle. The first Henkel product packaging with Social Plastic was launched in October 2018  it was used in 25,000 bottles for laundry detergents and household cleaners. Henkels Beauty Care business unit has also conducted successful pilot tests with Social Plastic. For 2019, both business units have planned to expand the use of Social Plastic in certain product lines. The Plastic Bank is an important strategic partner for Henkel. The social enterprise offers solutions to both the environmental problems of plastic waste and the social challenges posed by poverty and the lack of employment opportunities. The Plastic Bank has also demonstrated that its model is scalable and has the potential to be adapted for replication in other regions of the world. The partnership is supported by the Beauty Care and Laundry & Home Care business units. It will initially focus on Haiti, where the lack of waste management infrastructure means there is significant potential for positive impact. In addition, the opening of new collection centers is planned to further increase the availability of Social Plastic  while at the same time helping more people in poverty. Cross-industry initiatives for more sustainable packaging One example is our membership in the New Plastics Economy (NPEC), an initiative led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation that brings key stakeholders together to rethink and reshape the future of plastics and build momentum toward a circular economy. In October 2018, the New Plastics Economy introduced its Global Commitment, which has been signed by 250 organizations  among them Henkel. The collective goal: eliminate plastic waste and pollution at the source. Henkel is also founding member of CEFLEX, a consortium of around 100 European companies and organizations aiming to make flexible packaging  which frequently consists of multiple layers of film or foil that are often difficult to separate  easier to recycle. Each year, we present a Sustainability Award to one of our suppli-Taking advantage of renewable raw materials ers in recognition of its outstanding contribution. In 2018, we presented this award to Covestro for acting as a key partner in identifying alternatives that can replace hazardous materials. Covestros sustainable materials enable us to extend our range of safe and efficient manufacturing and design solutions for flexible packaging and wood engineering. We also work with our suppliers to explore potential renewable raw materials that offer a lower CO2 footprint compared to fossil-based alternatives. Many of our products already take advantage of renewable ingredients  and we aim to increase our use of these materials wherever this is compatible with environmental, economic and social considerations. As part of this approach, we are actively participating in several projects aiming to develop new supply chains for renewable materials. The open innovation project GreenSolRes is one example: This project aims to use levulinic acid  derived from waste wood pulp  to create alternatives to traditional fossil-based raw materials that are included in adhesives and pharmaceutical products. It brings together industrial partners, universities and research teams from across Europe to explore and evaluate potential new materials in terms of cost, environmental impact and technical performance. The project is funded with support from Henkel and is part of the BBI (Bio-Based Industries) program, which aims to encourage innovative technologies. Solar panels also rely on coatings and other technologies that protect the surface and make sure they are able to operate at the highest level of performance for as long as possible. Coatings that reduce reflection, repel dirt or reduce static can boost the energy generation of solar modules while also making them more durable  reducing downtime and maintenance costs. To strengthen our position as a leader in solutions for this market, Henkel recently invested in Kriya Materials, a startup based in the Netherlands. It is developing metal oxide nano particle technolo<BR>gies for solar panels, as well as a range of further applications. It focuses on solutions that have a positive impact on energy efficiency and durability. For example, Kriya is also working on a solution that embeds nano particles between two layers of glass and blocks out infrared light while allowing visible light to pass through. This can be used to keep the inside of a building or car cool  significantly reduc<BR>ing energy consumption related to air conditioning. Empowering resource-efficient performance In addition to our work on coatings for solar panels, we also provide coatings that extend the lifetime of industrial machinery and equipment. Our range of Loctite Polymer Composite coatings, for example, enables our customers to protect industrial pumps against wear and tear. This is particularly important because machinery of this kind is often operated continuously, which can cause abrasion and corrosion of the pump  leading to production downtime. The coatings can either be applied to the pump when it is manufactured or during maintenance of a pump that is already in operation. These technologies enable customers to increase the operational efficiency of their pumps by up to 12 percent, which can save more than 40 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year for each pump by reducing energy consumption. Extending the life of the pump in this way can also save our customers time and money by avoiding the need to replace parts  or even the entire pump. Ensuring consumer safety We use our deep industry knowledge and application expertise to help our customers make sure they are prepared for changes in legislation and consumer expectations well in advance. Back in 2008, our experts became aware of increasing consumer focus on Bisphenol-A (BPA), a molecule used in coatings that are applied to sheet metal when manufacturing food and beverage cans. While BPA is considered safe for use in these applications, many packaging manufacturers aim to proactively avoid materials that consumers may associate with risk in the future. The result is a new portfolio of coatings that are designed and formulated to function without BPA  and that match the performance characteristics of coatings containing BPA. By switching to one of Henkels new range of coatings, metal packaging manufacturers are able to keep up with changing customer demands. Recycling packaging waste Of course, our holistic approach to sustainability also includes measures after a product has been used. That is why our teams are engaging in partnerships that help our customers in the packaging industry respond to rising expectations related to recycling. One of our main focus areas is flexible packaging, which consists of multiple layers of film and foil that are bonded together. These materials are commonly used to make packaging for food because flexible packaging is strong and tear-resistant, ensuring that freshness and quality are protected until the product is used. It also weighs less than alternatives, which reduces the carbon footprint created during transport. However, the different layers of flexible packaging can be difficult to separate during the recycling process. Our experts are working with the Germany-based startup Saperatec to develop a solution to this challenge. Together, we are creating a technology that can be used to split the layers of flexible packaging and make the resulting material available for recycling. The solution has already been tested on a pilot line and is now being scaled-up for commercial volumes for post-industrial waste. As well as our collaborative projects with partners like Saperatec, we are also involved in initiatives that bring together stakeholders from across the entire value chain. These include the New Plastics Economy (NPEC), an initiative promoting a circular economy. Henkel is also a founding member of CEFLEX, a consortium of around 100 European companies and organizations aiming to make flexible packaging easier to recycle. This type of packaging is made using several layers of film or foil, which are often difficult to separate. In 2018, we also invested 5 million British Pounds into an impact fund managed by Circularity Capital, which invests in companies that are developing products and business models with potential to drive progress toward a circular economy. Raising awareness We also provide our customers around the world with advice, training and service along the entire value chain. This involves maintaining continuous dialog and training them in how to use our products in their applications safely and efficiently. We also leverage this close contact to strengthen customers awareness of sustainability. Our experts provide stakeholders from the food and packaging industries with insights into current legislation and technical developments related to food safety. Our Food Safe Packaging knowledge platform offers white papers, webinars and eLearnings in a range of languages. Since its launch in 2013, more than 6,000 participants have been able to communicate directly with Henkel experts during more than 110 webinar sessions. By sharing their knowledge, our teams enable producers to offer a very high level of safety in their food packaging. Driving social progress Alongside considerations related to safety and environmental responsibility, our global team also contributes to social progress by working with local communities and partners to create value. Our Welcome Home initiative, a program aiming to provide a safe home for families and children in need, entered its third year in 2018. Together with aid organizations, employees from the Adhesives for Consumers, Craftsmen and Building business area support the renovation and building of safe places to live. The goal of the program is to give people a foundation on which to build a better life through employee volunteering, raising funds and donating products. One of the key activities in 2018 was a weeklong project in Varna, Bulgaria, conducted in cooperation with Habitat for Humanity. Henkel employees, mainly from Bulgaria and Austria, supported the renovation of an apartment for a family who lost their home after a major flood. During the project week, a new facade with thermal insulation was installed, indoor walls were plastered and painted, and a new floor was put in place. 96 97 Sustainable product examples Fa deodorant The new generation of Fa deodorants offers particularly strong protection against body odor thanks to its innovative scent capsule technology. The environmentally compatible capsules consist of silicone and starch, and quickly release their scent in response to moisture or movement. In addition, the new formula contains twice the amount of renewable raw materials. They include more than 30 percent ingredients from natural sources classified in accordance with the ISO 16128 standard. Moreover, the high-performance formula contains around 70 percent easily biodegradable ingredients. The deodorant also helps save energy and CO2 because it no longer needs to be cooled during the production process and 25 percent of the packaging is made from recycled aluminum. Our new scent capsule technology provides optimal performance and is environmentally compatible. The formula and packaging also save energy and cut CO2 emissions during production. Recognize trends, adjust products to consumer demands and test reactions to new formulas: All this is possible in our newly opened Beauty Insights Center in Dusseldorf. for consumer testing at our Dusseldorf site offers fully equipped bathrooms where our Henkel experts can study the specific and individual use of our products. We can test and improve our existing and newly developed products in the testing center, while also gathering inspiration for new innovations by observing consumer behavior. We believe the only way to develop and effectively communicate resource-efficient product applications is by comprehensively understanding our consumers behavior. We use our brands to inform customers and consumers about the sustainable use of products and to give them suggestions for how to use resources responsibly. As a contribution to the overall Henkel goal of helping consumers save 50 million metric tons of CO2 by the year 2020, Beauty Care launched the BeSmarter initiative in 2016. Information on the product packaging, as well as an informative website and additional measures at the point of sale, explain how consumers can contribute to conserving resources. At first, the initiative was particularly focused on water as a resource, as well as on the energy-intensive process of generating hot water. In a regular household, more than 70 percent of all hot water is used for showering. This means a change in behavior while showering can have a significant impact. The next step in this initiative addresses recycling, particularly the responsible use and disposal of packaging. Consumers are informed and made more aware of the correct approach to waste, as well as the recyclability of different types of packaging. In this way, we want to raise consumer awareness of the concept of a circular economy. The BeSmarter initiative comprises ten brands and 31 countries. support young women in gaining the best possible entry into employ ment, and projects in the Start Up category support women make a new start into their professional or private lives. The winner of the fourth award was decided through a public voting process. The recipients of the first Million Chances Award (left to right): Waris Dirie (Desert Flower Foundation), Elisabeth Schoppner (Girls Day), Doreen Perwas and Gabriele Mohlke (Social Business Women e.V.), and Sunny Graff (Frauen in Bewegung e.V.). Working together to reduce plastic waste in the oceans Our strategic partnership with the social enterprise Plastic Bank, which we initiated in 2017, aims to reduce plastic pollution in the oceans while also creating new opportunities for people living in poverty. By creating three new collection centers for plastic waste in Haiti, it was possible to collect around 63 metric tons of plastic in 2018. The local population receives money, goods or services in exchange for the collected plastic. The plastic waste is sorted and processed, and ready for introduction into the recycling value chain as Social Plastic: Material that has been verified by the Plastic Bank to indicate that the collectors received an above-market price for the plastic waste. This enables single mothers, for example, to achieve an income to support their lives or pay for their children to attend school. The first pilot tests for the use of Social Plastic in cosmetics packaging were successful. We are planning to launch special edition products in packaging made from this material in 2019. The opening of additional collection centers is also planned, to further increase the availability of Social Plastic  while helping more people in poverty. Changing lives through hairdressing Another long-term project that is designed to help young people around the world secure a better future is Shaping Futures, which supplements the Schwarzkopf Million Chances initiative. Since 2010, Schwarzkopf Professional and non-profit organizations have offered young people the opportunity to obtain training in basic hairdressing techniques to establish livelihoods. One example is Bui Van Son, who was trained in 2012 together with 24 other young adults from an SOS Childrens Village in Vietnam as part of Shaping Futures. After completing his training, he successfully worked in several hair salons. Four years after starting his training, Son returned to his New self-confidence for cancer patients home region to open his own hair salon and work as a trainer as part of the Shaping Futures initiative. Since its foundation, the Shaping Futures initiative has trained over 2,200 young adults from 30 countries thanks to the efforts of volunteer hairdressers. In 2018 alone, the initiative conducted 23 training courses in 19 countries, including its first ever activities in Georgia and Armenia. The Shaping Futures initiative from Schwarzkopf Professional gives young people the opportunity to obtain training in basic hairdressing techniques and establish livelihoods. The picture shows Bui Van Son, who was trained by Shaping Futures and now works as a trainer for the program. With Million Chances, Beauty Care is also a partner of DKMS LIFEs look good feel better patient program. Since 1995, the nonprofit organization has been holding free cosmetic seminars to empower female cancer patients with a new sense of self-esteem and courage during cancer therapy. For nine years now, Beauty Care and DKMS LIFE have been organizing the Dusseldorf Charity Ladies Lunch to promote their commitment to female cancer patients. The National Breast Cancer Foundation in the United States also became a partner of Million Chances in 2018. We support this initiative through donations and fund-raising campaigns. In exchange, our employees in North America receive information about topics including breast cancer. 104 105 using ingredients based on renewable raw materials for decades. In 2018, around 30 percent of the organic ingredients in our laundry detergents and household cleaners were derived from renewable raw materials. In its approach to innovation management, Laundry & Home Care places an increasing focus on collaborative research and open innovation, harnessing the capabilities of external innovation partners such as universities, research institutes, suppliers and customers. Collaboration often begins before the actual development phase, in order to understand precisely what customers and consumers need, and to develop customized sustainable innovations for them. Research for increased sustainability Henkel has been supporting outstanding research at leading universities for many years. In 2018, the Laundry & Home Care business unit presented the Laundry & Home Care Research Award for the ninth time. Dr. Thiemo Fabach was honored for his research into washing-active substances, known as surfactants, at the Technical University Dortmund. Among other things, Dr. Fabach used terpenes, olefins and sugar extracted from plants as components to create new washing-active substances. The decisive element in this process was the use of a suitable catalyst to accelerate the reaction. Together with the industrial partner, a patent application was submitted for several substances. The research generated a total of twelve scientific publications. The results of Dr. Fabachs work are an important component of the further development of resourceefficient and climate-neutral products. In addition to its improved washing power, our new generation of liquid laundry detergents makes an important contribution to the reduction of our footprint along the entire value chain: We save 3.5 million kilograms of plastic per year in the production of the new bottles. Thanks to the more concentrated formula and a water-efficient production process, we use 120 million liters less water per year. In addition, we save 4.2 million kilograms of CO2 per year during the transport of our new generation of liquid laundry detergents and make it possible to take 7,000 trucks off the road per year. After use, the more compact bottles generate 50 million kilograms less plastic waste. The empty bottles are fully recyclable and can be introduced into the recycling process via disposal systems. To encourage our consumers to do their laundry in a more sustainable manner, we developed a new logo with the slogan be sustainable  wash cold. This helps to save an additional 724 million kilograms of CO2 emissions during the application phase. To motivate consumers to do their laundry in an environmentally compatible way, Henkel developed a special logo with the slogan be sustainable  wash cold. It is placed on our laundry detergent packaging and aims to encourage consumers to save energy when doing their laundry. Pro Nature  up to 95 percent ingredients from natural sources The products from the Biff, Sidolin and Pril brands contribute to sustainability in three ways: through their ingredients, through sustainable packaging and through our social engagement. At the same time, they offer hygienic cleanliness, a visible sparkle and grease-dissolving power. All formulas consist of up to 95 percent ingredients from natural sources, while protecting our waterways and the environment because they only use easily biodegradable surfactants and raw materials from sustainable sources. The products are certified in line with the independent eco-label The Blue Angel, which is owned by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conserva<BR>tion, and Nuclear Safety. This eco-label designates products that meet high environmental, health, and consumer standards and that are more environmentally compatible than comparable products. The new bottles also make a contribution to sustainability: Since 2018, the spray bottles and Pril Pro Nature bottles have been made from 100 per<BR>cent recycled plastic. The bottles are also fully recyclable once the attached foil sleeve, which has a perforated seam, has been removed. The Pro Nature product line also offers refillable packaging, which enables consumers to reuse the original bottle. Purchasing products from the Pro Nature product line also supports social engagement Sustainable packaging solutions through our partnership with the Plastic Bank. The spray bottles and bottles of Pril Pro Nature consist of up to 95 percent natural ingredients and are certified with the Blue Angel eco-label. The packaging is made of 100 percent recycled plastic and is fully recyclable. The key goals of Henkels packaging developers are the reduction and reuse of packaging materials, as well as the increased use of recycled materials. Together with its long-term partner, the packaging manufacturer Mondi, Henkel is working to increase the use of regranulate in the flexible packaging for its detergents. Our goal is to develop solutions that enable more recycled plastic waste to be used in highly functional, aesthetically pleasing composite materials for flexible packaging. In this way, the packaging of consumer goods will be better equipped to meet the environmental requirements of a circular economy. Henkel and Mondi are also working together with the plastics producer Borealis and recycling technology company APK AG as part of a joint development project aiming to significantly improve the sustainability of flexible packaging that consists of multiple layers. APK AG has developed a solvent-based process called Newcycling that enables the recovery of high-quality, clean-grade materials from complex multi-layer packaging. It makes it possible to recover sorted regranulates that offer properties similar to those of newly produced plastic materials. Brand engagement Working together to reduce plastic waste in the oceans Henkel was the first global consumer goods company to enter into a partnership with the social enterprise Plastic Bank in 2017. Our joint goal is to reduce plastic waste in the oceans while providing new opportunities for people in poverty. As part of the partnership, three new plastic collection centers have been built in Haiti. Local communities can return collected plastic waste and exchange it for money, goods, or social benefits. This creates value from plastic instead of letting it enter waterways or oceans as waste. Generating value from plastic: Local communities in Haiti can return collected plastic waste and exchange it for money, goods, or social benefits. Since launching our partnership with Plastic Bank, we have built three new plastic collection centers and a total of 63 metric tons of plastic have been collected. This Social Plastic is then reintroduced into the plastic recycling value chain. The first Henkel packaging made using Social Plastic has been available since October 2018. Packaging developers from the Laundry & Home Care business unit were able to use the recycled plastic in 25,000 laundry detergent and household cleaner bottles from the Sidolin and Silan brands. The first Henkel packaging containing Social Plastic has been available since October 2018. The plastic was collected in Haiti, then sorted and subsequently introduced into the recycling value chain. We plan to further expand our use of Social Plastic in 2019. Persil supports NaturKinder As part of the NaturKinder initiative, Persil and the German drugstore chain Rossmann have been helping children develop environmental awareness. Since it was established in 2013, the initiative has supported 66 projects run by schools, kindergartens, and non-profit organizations to teach a responsible approach to nature. 112 113 receive a certificate. However, qualifying as a Sustainability Ambas sador is only the first step: We encourage all ambassadors to use their skills and knowledge to make their own contributions and actively engage in sustainability. Henkels Sustainability Ambassadors are encouraged to visit schools to teach children about sustainable behavior in the home. At the Schlo-Gymnasium in Dusseldorf, Germany, students learned more about CO2 and climate change. Employee development It is our aspiration to create an appreciative working environment where all employees can develop and excel at Henkel in the longterm, and where they can give their best. To do so, we foster their skills and knowledge and help them to reach their full potential. Regular and open feedback on performance and potential serves as a foundation for their development. As a result, development measures can be defined individually that address both the companys needs and the employees potential. To meet our employees needs even more specifically, we have further expanded our digital learning offers. We are also strengthening the development of digital skills, so we can successfully leverage the opportunities presented by digitalization. Working digitally Digitalization is fundamentally changing the world of work. It creates new opportunities and challenges in the way employees collaborate, communicate and contribute to the companys success. We use digital communication channels to promote knowledge transfer throughout the company. One example of this is our social network Yammer, which is used to exchange views in subject-specific groups and to inspire each other. By enabling employees from a wide range of departments to make contact with each other, we can reinforce interdisciplinary thinking and better exploit our existing knowledge potential. Digital solutions help us to learn from each other, while also enabling us to work together more efficiently. As a result, project work and collaboration between teams are also increasingly supported digitally. This enables us to work on projects quickly and flexibly, and to exchange information quickly and personally in a virtual context. In searching for the best talent, we increasingly use digital channels to showcase what makes Henkel an attractive employer. Since our employees are the best judges of this, we have invited them to share their perspectives on social media channels including LinkedIn and Facebook under the hashtag #MyStory@ Henkel. Flexible working At Henkel, we measure performance by results and not by presence. This is why we have been promoting flexible working models for years. Based on a culture of trust, part-time work, flexible working hours, new workplace concepts and mobile working are a natural part of our work. Being able to work wherever and whenever necessary, regardless of time or place, improves the work-life balance. The trust we place in our people strengthens their motivation. Our managers are instructed to put opportunities for flexible working into practice and to support them actively. By signing our global Work-Life Flexibility Charter in Eike Dominiak explains what he thinks makes working at Henkel so attractive: an open corporate culture with a lot of knowledge transfer between young talents and very experienced employees.  For Management Board members, we also use an annual bonus as well as a bonus related to the companys long-term success as variable compensation elements. Details of this can be found in the remuneration report in the Annual Report, pages 42 to 61. We always assess the performance of our employees in the context of our vision and corporate values. We are committed to leadership in sustainability  this is one of our five corporate values. Correspondingly, contributions to Henkels sustainability strategy and to its targets form part of the comprehensive annual performance assess<BR>ment, which influences variable compensation. Where specific aspects of our sustainability performance, such as the reduction of energy use and waste volumes, fall within the sphere of influence of the employee concerned and have a clear bearing on business performance (as in the case of site managers), these are included in the individual performance assessment of this employee. In addition, almost every manager has to confirm compliance with the Henkel standards in writing during their annual review. These include our Code of Corporate Sustainability, the SHE Standards, and Social Standards. Our employee share program We believe it is important for our employees to share in the success of our business. This not only improves motivation, but also identification with the organization. Since 2001, Henkel has offered an employee share program. The intention of this is to align the interests of the company and those of our employees even more closely, while giving employees an attractive opportunity to provide individually for their future and their retirement. For each euro invested in 2018 by an employee (limited to 4 percent of salary up to a maximum of 4,992 euros per year), Henkel added 33 eurocents. Around 12,200 employees in 58 countries purchased Henkel preferred shares under this program in 2018. At year-end, around 15,600 employees held a total of around 2.4 million shares, representing 1.4 percent of total preferred shares outstanding. The lock-up period for newly acquired shares is three years. Development of an employee share portfolio for a monthly investment of 100 euros since January 2011   ,     &#3;,     &#4;,     &#5;,      ,      ,     &#3;,     &#4;,     &#5;,      ,        Avg. employee contribution Portfolio value Our contribution to social security Our employees worldwide benefit from a high level of social insurance provisions. In countries where no state social insurance system exists or such a system covers only basic needs, we organize our own measures and initiatives to supplement state health and pension insurance provisions. In the USA, for example, we cover our employees almost completely with private health insurance plans. In addition, in many countries where this is usual market practice, Henkel provides company pension provision plans. all of its approximately 9,000 employees and trainees in Germany basic insurance for outpatient, inpatient and semi-inpatient care. The insurance is available without a medical examination and waiting period. In addition to the basic insurance, employees can add the supplementary long-term care insurance and can also add family members, such as partners, children, parents or parents-in-law. This unique type of insurance was made available in Germany for the first time in September 2018. It took effect from January 2019 onwards. Diversity & Inclusion The diversity of our employees with their individual differences and perspectives is essential to our strength and innovative capabilities. Consequently, Henkel has been focusing on the subject of Diversity & Inclusion for more than ten years. We want to create an inclusive working environment in which every employee is valued and individual performance is recognized. With numerous programs, training courses and workshops, we strengthen understanding of diversity and appreciative behavior. Our flexible working models also contribute to our employees being able to maximize the use of their abilities in various life stages. What we mean by diversity and inclusion On principle, we fill our job vacancies exclusively according to ability, potential and performance. We do not tolerate discriminatory behavior either when we hire new employees or in our daily interaction with each other. We aim to develop the full potential of our employees, regardless of external circumstances. To do so, we want to identify and remove barriers in our thinking and in our processes. We are convinced that a diversified workforce and an open and appreciative corporate culture are important success factors in a globalized world. With our Global Diversity & Inclusion policy, we have promised to further strengthen diversity and appreciative behavior at Henkel. We want to create an inclusive working environment that fosters all dimensions of diversity. We pursue a holistic approach, which includes individual personal characteristics as well as experience, knowledge, and skills. Examples are:  Cultures: An international workforce composed of people with different cultural backgrounds is important in a global company like Henkel, as it enables us to develop an understanding of our markets. In order to meet the challenges of mixed teams, we provide intercultural training courses and workshops. These aim to increase awareness of different value systems and their influence on our daily behavior. Henkel also encourages international transfers within employees career paths. The experiences gathered open up new ways of thinking. With employees from a total of 120 countries, cultural diversity is a part of everyday working life at Henkel. 71 countries are represented at the corporate headquarters in Dusseldorf alone.  Life stages: Our employees are defined by their education, career paths, and social relationships in different life stages. The resulting activities and obligations pose the challenge of combining personal and working life in a reasonable way. We support our employees by offering them flexible working models. We also actively help families in achieving a work-life balance, for example, through the provision of childcare and our social services. Reliable childcare is a decisive factor in achieving a work-life balance for working parents. Henkel offers counseling and support to its employees returning to work from parental leave in many countries to help them find suitable childcare facilities. At the Dusseldorf site there are 240 childcare places in three company daycare centers. In 2015, the first Henkel company daycare center outside of Germany was opened in Bratislava, Slovakia. Childcare places for 100 children from two years of age were created here. Employee representation plays a particularly important role in Europe. In 1995, Henkel was one of the first German companies to voluntarily set up a European Works Council (EWC) to continue the successful cooperation between management and employee representatives at the European level. Through the EWC, Henkel informs the representatives of its European companies about matters such as the economic situation, transnational initiatives of the company such as restructuring or reorganization programs, safety, health and the environment, and training and development programs. In Germany, Henkel also involves employee representatives in many decision-making processes beyond those for which worker participation is a statutory requirement. The results of this decades-long, open and constructive cooperation between employers and employee representatives include, for example, an improved work-life balance, working hours, shift-work and break times, accident prevention and health protection in the workplace, company pension plans and retirement schemes through to preventive healthcare. In the close cooperation between Henkel and the Works Council, we are committed to providing support for the people behind Henkels success in order to successfully overcome new challenges together. Dealing with structural changes Preserving jobs and dealing with necessary structural changes responsibly are important to us. In order to secure the companys competitiveness, we continually adapt our structures to market conditions. If jobs are affected by this, we enter into a solution-oriented dialog with employee representatives before actions are taken. In doing so, we follow all applicable codetermination legislation and apply the required procedures for each action. We aim to reach agreements with socially compatible arrangements for the particular employees. To date, we have been able to manage the necessary restructuring measures while reconciling interests. The actions involved range from early retirement through to support with professional reskilling and refocus. Health and vitality We promote the health and vitality of our employees to help create an agile and high-performance organization. To do so, we rely on globally uniform health and safety standards and provide health and preventive care programs to guard against workplace risks that could lead to illness. The broad range of health services offered at the sites has two aims: promoting our employees physical health (via seminars for giving up smoking, health check-ups, AIDS prevention, etc.), and maintaining their mental vitality (through stress management and similar measures). We successfully pick up on important social trends, such as the demographic change, with our program for maintaining working capacity. In addition to a number of regional and local programs, we have been carrying out a major joint health campaign with all sites worldwide every year since 2016. For each global health campaign, Henkel has set itself the objective of reaching more than 90 percent of its employees worldwide in the year of implementation. In order to ensure holistic healthcare at all sites, we work continuously on establishing uniform principles. In 2014, a major step was to introduce global health protection metrics, such as the availability of first aiders and emergency medical care, carrying out occupational health screenings, and the number of cases of occupational illness. They are reported each quarter by all Henkel sites worldwide. The Health Procedure introduced in 2015 describes the minimum global standards for health protection and health promotion. In the implementation of internal guidelines, programs and legal requirements, regional managers for health, workplace safety and security provide support for the locations as the first point of contact, as well as during regular visits and training. In several regions, locally employed doctors also act as health managers, helping our employees by using their specialist knowledge and familiarity with the local conditions and the local language. In designing these programs, our sites determine different priorities based on local requirements. As recognition for our comprehensive healthcare philosophy, Henkel joined the business network Companies for Health back in March 2002. In this context, Henkel signed the Luxembourg Declaration on Workplace Health Promotion in the European Union dated 1997. As part of the companys efforts to continuously improve preventive healthcare measures, an annual exchange takes place enabling the physicians from all Henkel sites in Germany to share their experience. Global health management in Dusseldorf maintains weekly contact with colleagues from the regions. Important findings are made available to all sites worldwide. An annual survey of all Henkel sites on health programs and local requirements provides us with an overview of our global health management. This is the foundation for global and regional coordination activities as well as for site planning. Mental vitality and a healthy corporate culture In a world with constantly rising demands that is becoming increasingly complex and dynamic, operational measures to maintain mental vitality are becoming more and more important. For this purpose, Henkel supports its employees by offering consulting on the subjects of time, stress, and conflict management as well as coaching as a preventive, development and coping service. In addition, there are tailored care packages for the early medical treatment of health disorders. We also believe it is important to make our managers aware that they need to act as role models for their staff and teams. We use executive webinars to communicate this to them, so they can contribute to creating stronger motivation and a better atmosphere in the workplace combined with higher performance, while, at the same time, reducing instances of illness. At all German sites, the offer provided by our social services also plays an important role in supporting our employees professionally in all circumstances. In addition to giving psychological advice in particular cases, as well as occupational integration management, they also provide support in finding a work-life balance, for example by assisting in the search for childcare or help for relatives with care needs. At other sites, external service providers support employees needs according to local requirements. Our initiatives to create flexible working hours should also help to improve worklife balance and reduce stress factors. Demographic program to maintain health and working capacity Against the background of demographic change, the question arises as to what Henkel and its employees can do to achieve long-term employability up to the age of 67. Since 2013, at our corporate headquarters in Dusseldorf, we have been implementing a demography program after a successful pilot phase. This holistic concept includes a combination of preventive occupational healthcare with a general medical check-up, workability index, and employee interviews. From this we can derive profiles of individual employees strengths and weaknesses as well as those of the relevant organizational unit. Employees can be informed of the individual actions they need to take to improve and maintain their health and performance. Plant managers can see the need to take operational measures with regard to workplace design, continuing education, and optimizing the organization of work and the working atmosphere. This supports them in developing their teams. The plants are repeating the program since 2016. This makes it possible to evaluate the development and success of the measures. There were distinctly positive effects in maintaining working capacity and developing a healthier lifestyle. Key issues identified, such as lack of exercise and prevention activities, were addressed by the health campaign, as well as by the new preventive healthcare services available all across Germany. Third global health campaign 4 for Life After our first two global health campaigns Save a Life and Active Life, the third campaign in 2018 was dedicated to promoting cardiovascular health. As part of the 4 for Life campaign, our occupational health physicians recommended effective measures to prevent the respective four main causes of cardiovascular disease: high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol and smoking. Addressing these four causes could potentially help prevent up to 80 percent of all cardiovascular disease. The current health campaign provides practical tips for a healthier lifestyle. These include a good diet and a life free of smoking, as well as lots of sports and exercise, which strengthens the heart and cardiovascular system while also protecting against obesity and high cholesterol. On a globally accessible campaign portal, we provided detailed information about cardiovascular disease and the four largest risk factors. We also presented related preventative measures and actively communicated these across all channels. In the portal, we also collected information about local activities resulting from the health campaigns global call to action. With this approach, 4 for Life was able to reach more than 90 percent of the organization. Occupational safety Occupational safety within the company and along the value chain is a top priority at Henkel. We remain focused on our long-term objective of zero accidents. Our interim target is to reduce our worldwide occupational accident rate by 40 percent by the end of 2020 (base year 2010). To this end, we are continuously working on improving our workplace safety by providing awareness raising training and investing in enhancing technical safety. We regularly review whether our Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) standards are being strictly adhered to. We also want to improve occupational safety at our subcontractors and that of other companies employees working at our sites. Improved awareness of safety is a basic prerequisite for our employees to recognize and eliminate accident risks in the tasks they per-form. Regular training courses are held at all sites to make employees aware of this and to teach them to behave safely. We also conduct training sessions for the staff of contractors working at our sites. In addition, we are increasingly leveraging synergies across our business units for this purpose and are extending the programs already established in some units across the entire company. Since 2017, we have also been planning company-wide global safety campaigns that will target increased awareness of the most important safety issues. The Adhesive Technologies business unit has been concentrating on rolling out its Culture Based Safety (CBS) program globally since 2015. The core element is open dialog about safe and unsafe behavior in everyday work in order to avoid incidents. The focus here is on mutual encouragement to develop a safety culture, as well as on constructive feedback about unsafe behavior. In 2018 alone, around 68,000 conversations of this kind were held at 150 different sites. After the successful launch of the CBS program, we will focus specifically on quality assurance in 2019. We will also ensure that our new employees worldwide complete the CBS training. At the sites for our Beauty Care business unit, numerous trainings were held covering topics related to health and occupational safety. At our site in Bogota, Colombia, 23 activities with more than 650 participants were carried out during our SHE week. These activities focused on topics including working, speaking, learning, risk prevention, mindfulness, health and sustainability. At our plant in Chonburi, Thailand, we conducted training in how to identify and handle hazardous materials. We also introduced monthly safety training sessions at our North American production site in West Hazelton that are led by the management team. At our office and lab site in Dubai, we conducted safety, ergonomics and first-aid training. We also carried out an occupational safety evaluation for the new research and development lab and took related measures to enhance safety. Since 2018, the Laundry & Home Care business unit has been using a technical solution based on a modern radio system to strengthen occupational safety when using forklifts. An antenna is installed on top of the forklift and the employees are equipped with sensors that they wear on their clothes. This means all forklifts and employees are networked, which helps prevent collisions. The radio system particularly improves occupational safety in areas with restricted visibility, such as in the areas where pallets are loaded. In high-traffic pedestrian areas, the system can also be used to reduce the speed of the forklifts and can facilitate safe pedestrian crossings when combined with traffic lights. 2018 status In 2018, we recorded 1.0 occupational accidents per million hours worked. This is an improvement of 17 percent (base year 2010). In 2018, we had no fatal work accidents by a Henkel employee or any employee of an external company working on behalf of Henkel companies at one of our sites. 132 133 Corporate volunteering The Make an Impact on Tomorrow (MIT) initiative reached a milestone in 2018: We have now been supporting the volunteer activities of Henkel employees and retirees for 20 years. Since 1998, around 14,600 projects have been supported in more than 100 countries. MIT special project  Nepal The 20th anniversary of the MIT initiative provided an occasion to give special funding worth 50,000 euros to a social project in Nepal. The money will be used to build a mother-and-child health center in the Nepalese village of Namjung. Henkel employee Susanne Volkmann has been volunteering in Nepal for many years and regularly uses part of her annual vacation time to support this project. For more than ten years, the MIT initiative has been supporting her with financial donations and time off from work. MIT special project in Nepal: Susanne Volkmann and her team have already been able to help more than 10,000 children aged 13 and younger. She met her godchild, Avina Tamang, when she was eight years old and continues to have regular contact with her to this day. Sport brings us together Sport can overcome boundaries, build bridges and connect people. For Henkel, the support of sports events and initiatives is an important opportunity to connect employees with other participants in society. For the third time, Henkel supported the national Special Olympics in Germany  the largest sports movement worldwide for people with mental and multiple disabilities. Social partnerships Through our involvement in social partnerships, we support social initiatives and public institutions at Henkel sites around the world. The main objective is to promote education and equal opportunities in cooperation with the Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation. Habitat for Humanity Together with Habitat for Humanity, teams of Henkel employees have been building houses for families in need since 2014. In 2018, as part of one-week Building Trips, Henkel employees helped build multi-family houses for people in need in Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania and Canada. Henkel also supports these activities with donations in kind, for example with building materials. Brand engagement In addition to Henkels engagement on a corporate level, our brands are also involved in partnerships with social initiatives and public institutions around the world. Million Chances Since 2016, the Schwarzkopf Million Chances initiative has been pursuing its goal of helping girls and women overcome challenges, while also giving them confidence and prospects for their future. The initiative supports aid projects worldwide, often in cooperation with independent organizations such as Plan International Deutschland e.V. in Colombia, Egypt, and China. Around 17,500 women and girls were reached by 20 projects in 2018. The first Schwarzkopf Million Chances Award  sponsored by the Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation  was held at Henkels site in Dusseldorf. The award honored four non-profit projects for their outstanding commitment to supporting women and girls. Together with Plan International, Schwarzkopf Million Chances helps young women in Egypt prepare for a career, for example, by supporting them in getting ready for job interviews to improve their chances on the job market. Our Million Chances umbrella also involves our long-term initiative Shaping Futures: Since 2010, Schwarzkopf Professional and SOS Childrens Village have been offering young people the opportunity to obtain training in basic hairdressing techniques and establish livelihoods. More than 2,200 young people in 30 countries have already been trained thanks to the volunteer work of hairdressers and employees. Persil childrens book campaign As a family brand, Persil is committed to helping parents awaken a love of reading in their children. As part of the customer loyalty campaign Unser Bestes (Our Best), parents were given a childrens book if they bought two Persil products between October and December 2018. This enabled them to support a good cause because Persil donated one euro to the organization Mentor e.V. for every book that was distributed. By employing reading mentors, Mentor e.V. actively helps improve childrens reading skills, while also strengthening their ability to recognize and comprehend texts and images. NaturKinder As part of the NaturKinder initiative, Persil and the German drugstore chain Rossmann have been helping children develop environmental awareness. Since it was established in 2013, the initiative has supported 66 projects run by schools, kindergartens, and non-profit organizations to teach a responsible approach to nature. Emergency aid Henkel takes a fast and unbureaucratic approach to providing aid after natural disasters worldwide through the Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation. Earthquake in Indonesia In August, a massive earthquake on the Indonesian island of Lombok destroyed many buildings in the northeast of the island. Over 400 people died and more than 350,000 lost their homes. As a first step, the Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation provided urgently needed emergency financial support. Hurricane Florence and forest fires in North America In 2018, Henkel also provided immediate help after hurricane Florence hit the southeast of the United States and after the disastrous forest fires in California. The company supported the renovation of homes and provided typical household goods in the provinces and cities in which Henkel employees or their families were affected. In cooperation with global and local organizations, Henkel continues to support existing projects such as the reconstruction of houses and cities in the Philippines after the massive typhoon Haiyan in 2013. 138 139 This year, representatives from the plastics industry met in Ans felden, Austria, for the annual EREMA Discovery Days at EREMA, the global leader for plastic recycling machinery. The focus was on the future of the circular economy, innovative technologies and effective strategies. These topics were discussed by more than 1,000 participants representing a broad range of technologies, including cleaning, sorting and extruding. In many European countries, Henkel used the European Sustain<BR>able Development Week as a platform to celebrate the training of more than 50,000 Sustainability Ambassadors since 2012 and to thank all employees for their commitment. The Sustainability Ambassador program is now one of Henkels largest ever education initiatives. In the course of the week, Henkel employees were able to educate themselves on topics such as sustainable packaging and cor<BR>porate citizenship using webinars and videos. Henkel works in close collaboration with its stakeholders on challenging issues such as the promotion of sustainable palm oil. These stakeholders include NGOs such as the WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) and retail chains such as Carrefour. In 2018, the European As part of the European Sustainable Development Week, Henkels employees, here in Spain, celebrated the successful implementation of the Sustainability Ambassador program and raised awareness about different ways of making a personal commitment to sustainability. Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil was held in Paris. Hosted by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, which is the worlds largest organization for the certification of palm oil, the event focused on creating transparency in the entire palm oil supply chain and on the goal of achieving zero net deforestation. Henkel held discussions with other companies on the next milestones on the path to more sustainable certified palm oil  in order to mitigate deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions caused by the production of palm oil, while also improving quality of life and economic development in areas where crops are grown. This years meeting placed particular focus on joint projects for smallholders. Solidaridad and Henkel are continuing to expand their partnership for smallholders, who produce around 40 percent of palm oil and palm kernel oil worldwide. In countries where palm oil is produced, increasing the yield without increasing the area being cultivated is one of the most important issues. For this reason, Henkel and BASF are working together with the development organization Solidaridad as part of their commitment to supporting smallholders and local initiatives. Henkel currently supports seven initiatives in Colombia, Ghana, Honduras, Indonesia, Mexico, Nicaragua and Nigeria. To date, more than 29,000 smallholders have been reached that cultivate more than 350,000 hectares of land. The objective of the smallholder project in Nigeria is to provide access to new markets and ensure employment stability for local workers. Photo: Fedepalma. Henkel is also committed to supporting a sustainable palm oil economy in Germany. The Forum for Sustainable Palm Oil (FONAP) is a collaboration comprising 52 companies, NGOs and associations, as well as the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL). It was established in September 2013 and is based on an initiative from Henkel, Unilever, the retail group Rewe and the WWF. FONAPs commitment for regular members is based on three pillars: The switch to certified sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil as well as fractions and derivatives; supplier dialog focusing on traceability and achieving additional criteria; and detailed reporting on the achievement of goals. Henkel has also undertaken to use 100 percent Mass Balance-certified palm products by 2020 and to cover its own demand in this way. Guillermo von Bergen, President of Henkel Argentina, spoke about sustainability and Henkels packaging strategy at the fifth National Sustainability Forum in Argentina. At the German Sustainability Award, which attracts around 2,000 participants and is the most popular national congress on sustainability, experts from Henkel spoke with stakeholders and discussed the sustainability strategy and the contribution its brands make to sustainability. This year, the focus was on packaging and the circular economy. Cooperation with partners such as Plastic Bank is particularly important in actively promoting a circular economy along the entire supply chain. The German Sustainability Award is an initiative of the Stiftung Deutscher Nachhaltigkeitspreis e.V. in cooperation with the German Federal Government, the German Council for Sustainable Development, economic associations, local government associations, civil society organizations and research institutions. Dialog with politicians and government authorities Policymakers and government authorities often seek out the expertise of companies in their political decision-making processes. We take advantage of this opportunity to provide experience-based knowledge and to describe how political considerations impact Henkel, our employees, and business partners. Our Public Affairs Standard  Representation of Interests in Public Affairs, applicable worldwide, provides clear rules of conduct in this respect. In addition, we provide open information on our areas of interest and the scope of our political work, for example, through our entry in the EUs transparency register. Kathrin Menges, Executive Vice President Human Resources and Chair of Henkels Sustainability Council, has been a member of the German Council for Sustainable Development since 2013. The Council was first established in April 2001 by the German Education for sustainable development At Henkel, we believe it is important to address issues of sustainable development beyond our own sphere of influence. In 2017, Dr. Christoph Henkel and the foundations Konrad Henkel Stiftung and Fritz Henkel Stiftung endowed the Chair for Sustainability Management for Business Management at the Heinrich Heine University in Dusseldorf to mark the 25th anniversary of the Economics department. The aim of this endeavor is to contribute to meeting global challenges related to sustainability management by promoting teaching and cuttingedge international research in this field, with a particular focus on sustainable behavior. Since the winter semester of 2018, Prof. Dr. Rudiger Hahn has been the chair of the newly endowed Henkel professorship. His research and teaching activities focus on central issues of sustainability management where they interface with traditional business management disciplines. Thanks to the endowed professorship, Henkel has further strengthened its partnership with the Heinrich Heine University. The sponsors have endowed around 2 million euros, which will be provided over a period of ten years. 145 Indicators The indicators we record throughout the company offer transparency while helping us to identify potential improvements, manage activities and monitor achievements. We show the progress of each of our indicators over a five-year period. In this Sustainability Report, we focus on the publication of our globally relevant core indicators. The figures in the tables within this chapter have been rounded up or down. As a result, the rounded figures in some of the rows in the tables may not add up to the totals as indicated. Environmental indicators for our production operations The production-related data for 2018 were determined at all 185 Henkel sites in 56 countries. Thus, the data represent 100 percent of our production volume. The data were validated centrally for yearend reporting and verified at the sites within the framework of our internal audit program. Any differences discovered or reported at a later date are corrected retroactively in our reporting system. Since our production structures are constantly changing  due to the start-up of new sites or closure of existing sites, for example  the number of sites contributing data changes accordingly. To ensure the comparability of the annual data, we also show their progress as an index relative to the volume of production. Employee indicators Occupational accidents are registered using a globally uniform reporting system. 99 percent of Henkel employees are covered. The published employee indicators also covered 99 percent of our employees in 2018.               160 Contacts Corporate Communications Phone: +49(0)211-797-3533 Fax: +49(0)211-798-4040 E-mail: corporate.communications@henkel.com Sustainability Management Phone: +49(0)211-797-3680 Fax: +49(0)211-798-9393 E-mail: sustainability@henkel.com Except as otherwise noted, all marks used in this publication are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of the Henkel Group in Germany and elsewhere.

Oliver Blume I am of the opinion that sports cars actually foreshadow innovations, and that this was true in the past as it will be in the future. Ferry Porsche LETTER FROM THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF PORSCHE AG GROUP PHOTO GLOBAL PANDEMIC STYLE: THE BOARD MEMBERS ALL TESTED NEGATIVE FOR COVID-19 BEFORE HAVING THIS PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN Oliver Blume Detlev von Platen Chairman of the Sales and Marketing Procurement Executive Board Lutz Meschke Michael Steiner Research and Development Deputy Chairman of Human Resources the Executive Board Finance and IT Dear Reader, The year 2020 was a very challenging year. The coronavirus pandemic has severely tested human co-existence. Meanwhile, the global economy was subjected to a stress test. Porsche too was affected. We were forced to halt production for six weeks in the spring, and our dealership operations also had to temporarily close. Our response to these challenges was rapid, flexible and pragmatic. We introduced targeted measures to protect our workforce. And we engaged in systematic crisis management, successfully shoring up our liquidity and stabilising our results. In this way we steered Porsche strategically and robustly through the crisis. With good results. With deliveries of new vehicles totalling 272,162, we were a mere three per cent down on the record figure set in 2019. Our company remains highly profitable. Operating profit: 4.2 billion euros. Return on sales: 14.6 per cent. Figures that are unmatched in our sector. Figures that represent a great success for our entire team. In a difficult environment, that team has remained united, shown fighting spirit, and been dedicated to the task at hand. This success is founded on our fresh and attractive product range. 911 Turbo, 911 Targa, 718 GTS  thoroughbred sports cars, and the stuff of our customers dreams. Then there are our attractive best-sellers: the Cayenne and the Macan. Not forgetting our powerful Gran Turismo, the Panamera. Our electric mobility strategy has also provided a strong tailwind, noticeably gaining momentum in 2020. In Europe, one third of our new deliveries were already electrified, with an equal split between all-electric and hybrid vehicles. This figure will rise to 50 per cent by 2025. What this shows is that our electrification strategy is taking hold. Our success is driven by our innovative power. The technological strength that has always set Porsche apart has been concentrated in the Taycan, our first all-electric sports car. Its innovative 800-volt architecture already has a proven track record, used in our winning race cars at Le Mans. This architecture means that it is not only fast on the road, but also quick to recharge. In a further success story, the Taycan was voted the most innovative vehicle in the world in 2020. Internationally, it has picked up more than 50 awards  more than any other Porsche model has ever achieved in the space of one year. Porsche is clearly committed to the goals of the Paris Agreement, and is a trailblazer in this area. We are pursuing a consistent electrification and sustainability strategy. And we are setting ourselves ambitious decarbonisation targets, including in comparison with the rest of the industry. Porsche is also setting new standards in sustainable production. Our original plant in Zuffenhausen has been CO2-neutral since 2020, with the Leipzig plant following suit in January 2021. This is also where the all-electric Macan will come off the production line in future. This underlines our credentials as a sustainable mobility pioneer. Our goal is ambitious: Porsche will be completely CO2-neutral as early as 2030. We see ourselves as a partner in society and embrace the responsibilities that this involves  towards the environment, social issues and the economy. Porsche has, for example, supported countless social activities in 2020, the year of coronavirus. These have all been targeted and well coordinated, with a significantly increased volume of donations and a voluntary commitment from many employees. In addition, we supported the state governments of Baden-Wurttemberg and Saxony in the procurement of Personal Protective Equipment and made our expertise available to the crisis teams. Porsche has also been involved in many aid activities with an international aspect. This has greatly advanced our understanding of sustainability and carries us into the future. And we are also investing in our employees. Employees who work hard every day to inspire our customers  with pioneering spirit and passion. Last year, we signed works agreements to secure jobs at our locations until 2030, sending out a clear signal of our future intentions. Our team is highly motivated. With that team, we are successfully shaping the future of sustainable mobility. The new Porsche Strategy 2030 shows us the way forward. This also applies to the further expansion of our digital capabilities: we are systematically stepping up the efficiency, precision and quality of our processes. Making us even faster and even more flexible. We are undertaking considerable efforts to succeed in our goals: between now and 2025, Porsche will be investing 15 billion euros in electromobility, sustainable production and digitalisation. This is money well spent, not least because it will strengthen our commercial success and profitability in the long term. Even in an age of transformation, we remain as focused as ever on our strategic return target of 15 per cent. In 2020, Porsche showed impressively: our business model is robust and flexible. Our brand has never had such a positive appeal. Strategically, we remain firmly on course. Sustainability, innovation and digitalisation will determine our future path. We are also strongly and profitably positioned for the future. Our good performance in terms of return and capital value allows us to look to that future with confidence: we will embrace our opportunities with self-confidence and a down-to-earth approach. The Executive Board of Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG Letter from the Executive Board of Porsche AG The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212213. PORSCHE AND CORONAVIRUS: FACING THE CRISIS WITH DETERMINATION AS ATEAM Around the world, 2020 was a challenging year. The coronavirus crisis tested social cohesion to the limit. Pressure mounted on many business models, and global growth weakened markedly. At Porsche, production was forced to take a six-week break. Nevertheless, we successfully steered our company through the crisis and weathered the storm. Our people made the difference, coupled with innovative products, profitability and high levels of investment in the future. Even more, the crisis revealed Porsches true understanding of sustainability: a holistic view encompassing ecology, social factors and economy. Running your business at a profit gives it the strength it needs to face challenges. To take a current example, Porsche has been funding not-forprofit initiatives for many years. In spring 2020, the company donated an additional five million euros to specific coronavirus relief measures. Porsche also doubled its donations of groceries to food banks in the regions around our sites. What people outside the company rarely saw, however, was the teamwork that went on inside. Porsches response to the crisis was managed systematically and with a sense of responsibility. The Board of Management reacted at a very early stage to the worrying news from China. An expert group was convened to assess the situation around the clock as events unfolded. Porsche also established an interdisciplinary crisis team. Representatives from departments including Health Management, HR and Social Affairs, Production and Logistics, Research and Development, Finance and IT, as well as Sales and Marketing, joined forces in a situation room. The crisis team met each day, with the MORE THAN EVER, WHAT IS NEEDED TODAY IS A COMMITMENT TO SOCIETY AND OUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS. LOOKING OUT FOR EACH OTHER AND TAKING RESPONSIBILITY, JUST LIKE IN A FAMILY. THESE VALUES APPLY BEYOND THE FACTORY GATES. Oliver Blume, Chairman of the Executive Board Board of Management also regularly convening special meetings. Together they discussed hundreds of questions, such as where to store disinfectant for use by the workforce, how to rearrange servings in the factory canteens, how to restart our plants following the halt to production, and how to organise a return to working in the office for our staff. Instructions were clear, as employees were told to work remotely where possible. Meetings were held online and business trips were cancelled. Only the most essential journeys were permitted. Anyone returning on a flight from abroad was required to quarantine at home for two weeks as a precaution. The approach was one of safety first  no compromises. On 21 March 2020, it became necessary to stop production because of shortages in global supply chains. The lines would not move for a further six weeks. However, on 4 May 2020 Porsche restarted its production facilities and barely four weeks later was back to working at its normal capacity. In the USA, around half of all dealerships had to shut their doors temporarily in March and April. All dealership operations has already closed in February in China. Nevertheless, demand in the biggest sales market recovered rapidly from April onwards. By the beginning of summer, sales in China were almost back at the previous years level. Operations in Japan and South Korea also grew. The development of key Asian markets continued on a positive track for the rest of the year. During the crisis, a start-up that was co-operating with Porsche encountered financial difficulties. Porsche took over the company to keep the business going and secure jobs. When grappling with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Porsche pursued a clear strategy. All necessary steps were initiated systematically. The workforce was actively involved. At the height of the crisis Oliver Blume delivered a weekly video message with the latest updates on the situation. The internal Carrera media carried daily information too. Communication has always been a core function at Porsche, and continues in this role. As Oliver Blume says, Everyone in the business needs to be on the ball. Information, education and transparency are key. Through these efforts, Porsche has succeeded in winning its employees confidence and navigating the business safely through the crisis. The focus has always been on health and safety at the workplace. Looking back, everyone knows and understands the rules about maintaining distance, hand-washing and face coverings, as well as the difference between an FFP2 mask and a face shield. It was not easy, suddenly having to keep 1.5 metres away from colleagues. However everybody understood how important it was for them all to do their bit. Success requires teamwork. The crisis management activities actually pushed some trends and developments to a new, higher level ready for the future. For example, it suddenly became possible to stream the annual press conference online. When the Geneva International Motor Show was cancelled at the beginning of March, Oliver Blume and Porsche Brand Porsche and Corona Ambassador Mark Webber introduced the 911 Turbo S in an English-language web press conference broadcast on Porsche News TV. The broadcast went out simultaneously in Chinese. And starting in February, sales in China moved onto the WeChat platform. In short: digitalisation has received a massive boost. The same applies to collaboration with politics and society. Standing shoulder-to-shoulder during the crisis was an important experience. Consultants from subsidiaries Porsche Consulting and management and IT consultancy MHP supported the crisis teams at the state governments in Baden-Wurttemberg and Saxony. Porsche organized the supply chains for the delivery of Personal Protective Equipment from China. Hundreds of millions of articles flowed through these channels. With up to six cargo flights each week at the busiest time, Porsche worked with its logistics partners DB Schenker and Lufthansa Cargo. Background: the issue was that the two state governments did not have the necessary procurement organisations of their own to purchase the volume of protective personal equipment needed. Porsche gladly came to the rescue, as Oliver Blume explained in an interview, From day one, we have not seen Porsche in isolation as a business entity, but have also considered our role and responsibility within society. What can we do for people who are in need of emergency assistance? How can we support the countries and regions in which we are represented? We focus on a fundamental perspective: we are there for people in times of crisis too. IMPORTANT EVENTS Business Performance Outlook The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212 213. IMPORTANT EVENTS 911 CARRERA 4S BELGIAN LEGEND EDITION WITH MOTOR RACING LEGEND JACKY ICKX Tribute to Jacky Ickx: 911 special edition (Type 992) Belgian racing driver Jacky Ickx celebrated his 75th birthday on 1 January 2020. In a tribute to this motorsport legend, Porsche has designed a very special 911 Carrera 4S (Type 992), the Belgian Legend Edition. The 75 units were only available for sale in Belgium. Jacques Bernard Jacky Ickx is one of the most successful drivers ever to race and by far the best all-rounder, with victories in Formula 1, Formula 2, the world sportscar championship, touring cars, the CanAm series in the United States and long-distance rallies to his name. In the 1970s and 1980s he notched up many wins for Porsche, taking top honours at the 24 Hours of Le Mans six times. In 1983 Ickx suggested to Helmuth Bott, the Executive Board Member for Development at the time, that Porsche should enter the Paris Dakar rally. One year later he was part of the team and Porsche had won the event. To the engineers who worked with him for almost ten years in Weissach, Ickx is a legend. He was also personally involved in the design of the Legend Edition, together with experts from Style Porsche and the Belgian Porsche importer DIeteren. In a tribute to this motorsport legend, Porsche has designed a very special 911 Carrera 4S (Type 992), the Belgian Legend Edition. Marc Rie appointed as COO of Porsche Financial Marc Rie, 43, took over as Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Porsche Financial Services in February. Rie previously spent eight years as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Porsche Financial Services in the United States and Canada since 2012, where he was responsible for risk management and controlling. He has been with the company since 2003, working in various different management positions at Porsche Financial Services, whose portfolio comprises close to 250,000 leasing and finance contracts with a volume of around 7.4 billion euros worldwide. The total number of contracts and size of the portfolio have almost doubled over the past five years. The previous Chief Operating Officer, Jorg Pape, has taken up the position of CEO at Volkswagen Financial Services Brazil. Pure driving pleasure: The new GTS models Two new 718-GTS 4.0 models are a good reason to look forward to spring with the 718 Cayman GTS 4.0 and 718 Boxster GTS 4.0 due to be launched later this year. These new two-seaters have four-litre six cylinder flat engines. The new-generation GTS strikes a noteworthy balance between a taut, sports setup and everyday comfort. The standard Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) sports suspension con tributes to this, as does the 20 millimetre drop in ride height and Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV) with mechanical rear differential lock. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212 213. Taycan at the Miami Super Bowl The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL) and the sporting event of the year in the United States. For the first time since 1997, Porsche featured in a TV advertisement on 2 February, the day of the Super Bowl in Miami. And the main character in this commercial was the Taycan. Entitled The Heist, the ad was based around a car chase involving nine classic Porsche sports cars from the Porsche Museum. Germanys Black Forest, the city of Heidelberg and beautiful timberframed architecture of Heppenheim all provided the backdrop. An extended cut is available to view on Porsche NewsTV and the Porsche YouTube channel. Mark Anstotz heads Porsche Centre Berlin-Adlershof Mark Anstotz, 33, was promoted in February from the position of sales manager at the Porsche branch in Hamburg to head up the Porsche Centre Berlin-Adlershof. He is now part of the management team led by Tobias Roch, who is in overall charge of the Porsche Centres in Berlin. With a publicly accessible 800-volt fast charging point and 25-metre photovoltaic pylon, the Berlin-Adlershof site is one of the most modern and sustainable Porsche locations in the world. Porsche Charging Service: More than 135,000 charging points in 20 countries To coincide with the delivery of the first Taycan vehicles in Europe, Porsche has been involved in setting up a high-performance charging network: the Porsche Charging Service gives customers access to more than 135,000 AC and DC charging points in 20 countries. This service is included for Taycan customers for the first three years. There are a further 2,000 AC charging points provided by Porsche Destination Charging at selected hotels, golf courses and marinas in 20 different countries. Porsche customers can charge their vehicle here at no cost. Meanwhile, the entire Porsche dealer network is also being equipped with 800-volt fast-charging stations. Along Europes motorways and main traffic routes, the joint venture IONITY maintains more than 400 fast-charging parks. The joint venture was established by the Volkswagen Group with the Audi und Porsche brands, the BMW Group, Mercedes Benz AG, Ford Motor Company and Hyundai Motor Group. Taycan drivers can charge their vehicles through the Porsche Charging Service app at a particularly favourable rate of 0.33 euros per kilowatt hour across the board, which is significantly lower than the walk-up rate. Thanks to the 800 V technology installed at the IONITY charging stations, the Taycan can charge at its full potential of up to 270 kW. To coincide with the delivery of the first Taycan vehicles in Europe, Porsche has been involved in the creation of a highperformance charging network. Breeze Technologies wins sustainability ideas competition The Hamburg-based start-up Breeze Technologies was the winner of Porsches Mobility for a better world ideas competition at the end of January. Founded in 2017 by Robert Heinecke and Sascha Kuntze, the start-up impressed the judging panel and the public with its forward-looking environmental sensor technology and analysis software. The Breeze Technologies team are focusing on low-cost air quality sensors. Using artificial intelligence, Breeze identifies local sources of emissions and recommends efficient and specific measures for clean air. The panel considered more than 150 projects, with prize money of 20,000 euros. Awards went to Phantasma Labs (Berlin), Ducktrain (Aachen) and Liight (Madrid). Neng (New Zealand), Third Space Auto (Finland) and Charger Next Door and IUPETIR, both from Berlin, all qualified for the final. Porsche Ventures invests in Nitrobox start-up Porsche Ventures is the venture capital arm of Porsche. In February, it invested in the Hamburg-based software start-up Nitrobox GmbH, which helps companies to centralise and flexibly manage their financial processes. New digital products and services can then be brought to market more quickly while keeping costs down. Nitrobox supports the order-to-cash process for new business models: billing for car sharing, functions on demand, digital parking tickets and charging services can be fully automated using the start-ups platform. Nitrobox GmbH received a seven-figure investment, with the NeueCapital Partners fund from Silicon Valley also acquiring a stake in the start-up. VDA Logistics Award goes to Porsche Leipzig In early February, the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) presented Porsche Leipzig GmbH with the VDA Logistics Award 2020. Porsches concept was based on smart planning tools, highly automated processes and energy-efficient storage and order-picking technology. The panels verdict was as follows: Strongly integrated, with smart automation and maximum reliability and efficiency, the concept offers innovation potential for the plant, the automotive industry and logistics in other industries. With a saving of 3,500 tonnes of CO2 per year, Porsche is setting standards in the conservation of resources. At the heart of the automated small parts warehouse are 90 carts that feed and empty all of the small load carriers in two aisles. A fully automatic robot is used for the loading process. This innovation supports the high level of variation in production, cuts costs and makes workplaces more ergonomic. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212213. Porsche went electric back in 1900 20 years of the Retro Classics motor show in Stuttgart  120 years of electric mobility from Porsche. 120 years? An exhibition at the Porsche Museum in late February revealed why the history of Porsche had an electric start. In 1900, Ferdinand Porsche built his Lohner Porsche Semper Vivus (Always Alive). His aim was to mitigate the disadvan tages of battery weight and range of earlier versions. A faithful replica of his design, the world's first, fully functioning hybrid vehicle, was presented by Porsche 120 years later. Porsche Consulting: Record sales and three new locations Sales grow by 17.4 per cent to 203.1 million euros: Porsche Consulting presented its new record results for 2019 in mid-February. The new Future Lab in the Berlin city office literally looks to the future.

The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212213. Works driver Kurt Ahrens celebrates 80th birthday On 19 April, Porsche paid tribute to a very special man as Kurt Ahrens celebrated his 80th birthday. The story of racing driver Kurt Kurti Ahrens from Braunschweig is as if borrowed from the 1955 Heinz Ruhmann film Wenn der Vater mit dem Sohne, a film about following in a father's footsteps. Kurti is the son of racing driver Kurt Ahrens, who took his son with him to the track and soon had him racing too. By the age of 28 Kurt Ahrens was a racer in his own right. He made his debut at the German Grand Prix on the Nurburgring in 1968, alongside Jack Brabham and Jochen Rindt in the Brabham Repco. But Kurt Ahrens then decided against a career in Formula 1, opting instead to take care of the family business. From then on he only raced at weekends and celebrated successes as a Porsche works driver: in 1969, he secured victory with Joseph Siffert in the Porsche 917 over the 1,000 km Zeltweg race in Austria. He also topped the podium with Vic Elford in the Porsche 908/03 in the 1,000 kilometre race at the Nurburgring. And he still participates in events at the Porsche Museum to this day. Puma design featuring automotive elements. A T-shirt features various elements from the world of motor racing. Puma launches Porsche Legacy Collection on the market The sporting goods supplier from Herzogenaurach advertises with the slogan Puma the fastest sports brand in the world. In April, Puma elegantly backed up this slogan with its launch of a collection inspired by the Porsche 911 Turbo. The Porsche Legacy Collection combines Puma design with elements from the automotive sector. A T-shirt features various elements from the world of motor racing. There are two pairs of trainers in the collection, like this one iconic Speedcat, bringing authentic racing design to the streets. 70 years of collection ex-works A love of cars can take drivers down many roads, but when that road leads to Zuffenhausen, people are still telling stories like Ottmar Domnicks 70 years later. On 26 May 1950, the 43-year-old specialist in neurology and psychiatry took delivery of his 356 in Fish Silver Grey with commission number 5001. It was his dearest wish to be the first Porsche customer in Germany. The mechanic Herbert Linge remembers the day well: Domnick celebrated the handover. But he had been dropping in every day before that anyway to see how far we were with the work on his car. 70 years later, about 20 customers a day drive their new car out of the gates. That makes around 2,500 customers a year in Zuffenhausen, and 3,000 in Leipzig. Serendipity and an unbreakable love of cars meant that, in the 70th year of ex-works collection, the very first Taycan was also received in person in Zuffenhausen. More about that in 70 years time! On 26 May 1950, the 43-year-old specialist in neurology and psychiatry took delivery of his 356 in Fish Silver Grey with commission number 5001. It was his dearest wish to be the first Porsche customer in Germany. Pop-up stores: The Porsche NOW concept Cars go where customers like to go, to the shopping centre. In mid-May, Porsche and the Hahn Group joined forces to open a pop-up store south of Stuttgart in Breuningerland Sindelfingen: under the name Porsche NOW, retail partner the Hahn Group presented and sold Porsche sports cars up until the end of the year. Porsche NOW is a flexible retail concept designed for short-term use. It was created with busy city centres and shopping malls in mind, and is intended to appeal to new target groups. Retail formats of the future will mean Porsche delivering the basic concept, and the worldwide sales companies and dealers implementing it. Another pop-up shop was opened in Tokyo in July. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212213. Online global premiere: 911 Targa on Porsche web TV For the first time Porsche presented a new model to the global public using its own web TV format: brand ambassadors Maria Sharapova and Jorg Bergmeister unveiled the new 911 Targa in mid-May. The Coupe and Cabriolet models were followed by the allwheel drive 911 Targa 4 and 911 Targa 4S, a third option from the new generation of 911. A striking feature remains the fully automatic roof system with its characteristically wide roll bar, a movable roof section above the front seats and a wraparound rear window. Both models are powered by a three litre twin-turbo flat-six engine. Back in 1965, the 911 Targa 2.0 set the tone for a new class of sports car and paved the way for a new, independent concept: as a vehicle with a removable roof. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212 213. Headlight expertise: Porsche builds new light tunnel Porsche is expanding its development centre in Weissach, adding a new test bench for the development of headlights. The plans include the creation of a 100-metre long tarmac light tunnel, an analysis and testing area, and a new light measurement laboratory. The facility is scheduled to come on line in 2022. The existing light assessment track measures 30 metres. To carry out some of their measurements, the engineers currently have to go to the outdoor measuring track and wait for nightfall. In future, the new facility will allow night-time measurements to be taken in the light tunnel at any time of day and in the dry. Track the production ofyourvery own Porsche online!

My Porsche is the central customer portal for vehicle owners and pools all of the offers and services for their individual vehicle. Gerard Larrousse, the fastest Frenchman, turns 80 Racing drivers have a never-ending supply of tales to tell. As far as Gerard Larrousse is concerned, these two are particularly notable: in 1969, he and Hans Herrmann missed out on victory at Le Mans  in the closest race for the chequered flag of all time  by 120 metres! In 1970 he came third in the Tour de France. On 23 May 2020, Gerard Larrousse turned 80 and shared a third and a fourth anecdote: in 1968, behind the wheel of his Renault Alpine 1300, he was the greatest rival of Porsche works driver Vic Elford at the Monte Carlo Rally, the latter driving his 911 T. It was only when spectators began throwing snow on the road that Gerard lost control of the car and had to drop out. But Larrousse had the last laugh. When Porsche engineer Peter Falk asked Elford, a Brit, who the best Frenchman was, he replied: Larrousse! Falk brought him to Porsche. Elford and Larrousse won the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1971 with the 917, and the 1,000-kilometre race at the Nurburgring with the 908/03 Spyder. Lifestyle icons: The 911 Targa 4S Heritage Design Edition Exclusive paintwork, gold-coloured targa lettering, and a white film wrap in the historic design - voila, the 911 Targa 4S Heritage Design Edition is here! Porsche presented this special model in June. It is a designer piece adorned with quotes from the 1950s and early 1960s, and spear-shaped motorsport decals on the front wings, a motif from the early days of Porsche motorsport. The Heritage Design models are synonymous with lifestyle. Porsche will be launching four special models at intervals and in limited production runs: iconic 911 models with features from the 1950s to the 1980s. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212 213. Remembering designer Hans Mezger Hans Mezger was an engine designer and inventor of the world-famous Mezger engine. He died on 10 June at the age of 90. Porsche has Mezger to thank for the air-cooled flatsix engine in the 911, the TAG turbo and the overall design of the 917 and its twelvecylinder power unit. Mezgers journey to Porsche exemplifies just how strong the pull of a brand can be and how Porsche makes the best better in an inspiring environment. Mechanical engineering graduate Hans Mezger from Ottmarsheim near Ludwigsburg was 27 when he found himself with 28 job offers on the table in the midst of Germanys economic miracle. Porsche wasn't one of them. But I wanted to go to Porsche! And he did. Influenced by the pioneering spirit of a Ferry Porsche, he developed the Mezger engine, which was to become world-famous, took charge of the newly created racing car design department in 1965 and built the Ollon-Villars-Bergspyder in the space of 24 days, shortly followed by the 910. In the early 1980s, Mezger was commissioned by McLaren to design a completely new Formula 1 turbo engine that would produce more than 1,000 hp on the track. The result was that he virtually made Niki Lauda the world champion in 1984 followed by Alain Prost in 1985/86. It is easy to imagine Mezger as a happy person: his own engine design would accompany him as he drove his 911 Carrera 3.0 for many years to come. 50 years after victory at Le Mans Porsche commemorated its Le Mans triumph from 50 years ago with an exhibition on 14 June and presented the red and white winning car, a 917 KH, at the Porsche Museum. Drivers Hans Herrmann and Richard Attwood took the first overall victory for Porsche in the 24 Hours of Le Mans on 14 June 1970. After 343 laps and 4,607.811 kilometres. Gerard Larrousse and Willy Kauhsen came second in the Martini Porsche 917 LH, and Rudi Lins and Helmut Marko in the Porsche 908/02 finished third. Since then, Porsche has notched up 19 overall victories and 108 class wins at Le Mans. It is the most successful manufacturer in Le Mans almost 100-year history. Le Mans goes virtual: Esports team victorious Porsche has enjoyed success in sim racing too. Sim is short for simulation and refers to video gaming. The virtual edition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans on 13 and 14 June ended with a victory for the newly established Porsche Esports team. The sim racing drivers were Nick Tandy (United Kingdom), Ayhancan Guven (Turkey), Joshua Rogers (Australia) and Tommy stgaard (Norway). The 2020 season of the Porsche TAG Heuer Esports Supercup was won by Sebastian Job from Team Red Bull Racing Esport. This global Esports championship will be staged for the third time in 2021. An SUV duo, with sporting chassis set-up and exclusive equipment in the GTS tradition Porsche presented two new, high-performance Cayenne models in mid-June: the Cayenne GTS and Cayenne GTS Coupe. They are powered by a four-litre twin turbo V8 engine producing 338 kW (460 hp). Both models, with the Sport Chrono Package, can sprint from zero to 100 km/h in 4.5 seconds. Top speed: 270 km/h. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212 213. CO2 offsetting: Porsche Impact extended to further markets In June, Porsche expanded its Porsche Impact service. Using the Porsche Impact online calculator, customers can calculate and then offset the specific CO2 footprint of their own vehicle by supporting international climate projects. These projects range from protecting forests in North America and Australia to energy generation from hydroelectric and wind power in Vietnam and China. Around 45,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide were offset in this way during the pilot period from December 2018 to April 2020. The Porsche fleet also contributed to this. However, at Porsche, avoiding and reducing CO2 emissions take precedence over offsetting. After Germany, the UK, Poland and the USA, this service is now available in 15 other countries: China, Canada, Singapore, Brunei, Cambodia, French Polynesia, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam, Mongolia and the Philippines. The online emissions calculator lets drivers calculate and offset their vehicles specific CO2 footprint. They can choose to support a range of international climate projects run by offsetting partner, South Pole. These projects range from protecting forests in North America and Australia to energy generation from hydroelectric and wind power in Vietnam and China. Porsche acquires a stake in serva transport systems In July, Porsche acquired serva transport systems GmbH, a technology start-up based in Rosenheim, Germany. Serva offers driverless transport systems. Intelligent software and transport robots are used to automate logistics, for example in production of the Taycan, for which Serva systems have automated the logistics of the assembly line. The start-up found itself facing financial difficulties as a result of the pandemic. In order to safeguard business operations and secure jobs, Porsche initially transferred the company to Porsche Ventures, its in-house investment and holding structure. On 1 August, the newly created serva GmbH became a Porsche subsidiary. Porsche Drive now known as Porsche Drive Rental In July 2020, Porsche Drive became the new umbrella brand for Porsche mobility services worldwide. The premium rental service is now called Porsche Drive Rental. It has been expanded to ten domestic locations in the reporting year, including the Porsche Centres in Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Cologne, Leipzig, Munich Olympiapark and Saarbrucken. Porsche Drive Rental offers flexible rental of current Porsche sports cars for periods from as little as three hours up to 28 days. In August, the company added the Porsche Drive Abo flexible subscription model to its offering for customers in Germany. This allows vehicles to be rented on the basis of a monthly package price (excluding fuel costs), subject to a minimum term of six months. The range of vehicles includes young Porsche Approved used cars from various model series. The transactions are concluded directly through the Porsche Centres. In future, this type of deal will also be available through the online sales channel. Porsche Drive Abo followed the one-year pilot project Porsche inFlow offered in conjunction with Porsche Digital GmbH. The next generation of the Macan, which will be fully electric, is to be manufactured in Leipzig. Three different drive technologies can now be produced on one assembly line: petrol engines, hybrids and electric drive systems. Fifth plant expansion in Leipzig The Porsche plant in Leipzig is on the way to becoming the electric vehicles plant. Porsches initial assessment of the construction work in July was positive. Preparations are in progress across the entire site for the launch of electromobility. This marks the fifth expansion of the plant since the initial ground-breaking ceremony in 2000. Porsche is investing more than 600 million euros in the production of entirely electric vehicles. The next generation of the Macan, which will be fully electric, is to be manufactured in Leipzig. Three different drive technologies can now be produced on one assembly line: petrol engines, hybrids and electric drive systems. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212213. From zero to a hundred in 2.8 seconds: 911 Turbo Coupe and Cabriolet The Porsche Turbo was 45 years old in mid-July, and the company celebrated with the market launch of the new 911 Turbo Coupe and Cabriolet. Both are more powerful, even faster and even more individual, and both models dip under the magic three second 0-100 km/h mark with a time of 2.8 seconds. Options such as the Sports and Lightweight Design packages, sports chassis and sports exhaust system are available for the 911 Turbo for the first time. Since 1975, the 911 Turbo has been synonymous with top performance. Each generation has continued to live up to the claim of being a global benchmark for high-performance sports cars. The latest generation of the two-plus-two seater is more than twice as powerful as the original Turbo, which was powered by a three-litre flat six. The 911 Turbo has, however, consistently retained its fundamental characteristics. An electromobility pioneer The special exhibition Porsche - An electromobility pioneer was staged from July to November at the Volkswagen Group Forum in Unter den Linden, Berlin. Porsche showcased its first fully electric sports car, the Taycan, as part of the Start to Drive Electric range. The exhibition focused on relevant electromobility topics such as range and battery power, infrastructure and charging technology. It traced the complete story from todays electric innovation to the pioneering spirit that has flourished in Zuffenhausen for more than 70 years. Porsche fleet in rainbow colours to mark CSD At the end of July, the company presented six Porsche 911s in the rainbow colours of red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet to mark Christopher Street Day (CSD). In front of the Porsche Museum, the company demonstrated its commitment to the values of diversity, tolerance and respect. A rainbow flag was flown from the factory mast. Porsche stands for open cooperation and active diversity. The motto of this years CSD was Diversity needs support. Porsche HR Board Member Andreas Haffner explained, We demand and promote equal opportunities and want to enable everyone at Porsche to contribute as they are  regardless of gender, ethnic origin, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation. In 2017, Porsche set up its Equal Opportunities and Diversity department to raise awareness of diverse teams. SPORTY ELECTRIC MOBILITY AT PORSCHE We demand and promote equal opportunities and want to enable everyone at Porsche to contribute as they are  regardless of gender, ethnic origin, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation.

In the first episode, CEO Oliver Blume and journalist and entrepreneur Kai Diekmann talked about coronavirus and its consequences for public life, society and business. Every month the podcast tackles topics from the world of business, society and sport. The podcast is hosted by Sebastian Rudolph, Vice President Communications, Sustainability and Politics at Porsche. An English-language version has also been available since November, with the name The Porsche Podcast. All episodes are available at newsroom.porsche.de/podcasts. Pilot project to research eFuels Porsche unveiled its commitment to synthetic fuels (eFuels) in September. This area of activity includes a pilot project launched jointly with Siemens Energy and a number of international companies: the worlds first integrated and commercial large-scale plant in Chile is scheduled to produce near climateneutral eFuels from 2022. Porsche will be the main customer. eFuels are produced from carbon dioxide and water using renewable energy. In terms of their basic properties, they are no different from petroleum-based fuels. Using eFuels can help make an important contribution to climate protection: with eFuels, vehicles with combustion engines can potentially be made climate-neutral. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212213. Minister President Kretschmer visits Leipzig plant In early September, Michael Kretschmer, Minister President of the Free State of Saxony, visited the Porsche site in Leipzig to see how the plant expansion was progressing. During his visit he pledged his support for the transition to climate-friendly mobility.

Startup Autobahn: Mobility ideas from across the world At the finale of Europes largest innovation platform Startup Autobahn in September, over 30 start-ups from all over the world presented their mobility of the future ideas online. Porsche was involved in five projects, making experienced mentors available to the founders. The CarbonBlock sustainability project set up by the Berlin start-up Circular-Tree, which Porsche helped to establish, also won the Global Innovation Award from the American accelerator Plug and Play. The blockchain application developed by the project makes greenhouse gas emissions from supply chains transparent. Meanwhile, the app developed by Circularise (Netherlands) can be used to trace the individual plastic content of a product part. ClimaCell (USA) adopts a weather of things approach and uses several hundred million sensors to do so. Monk from France speeds up the return and inspection of rental cars and lease returns. The Hi.Auto application from Israel is working on audiovisual speech recognition. In addition to the microphone, a video camera records lip movements. Porsche has been a Startup Autobahn partner since the start of 2017. Since early 2019, Porsche has been manufacturing the doors and rear wing of the small series racing vehicle out of a natural-fibre mix, sourced primarily from renewable raw materials. The vehicle that raced at the Nurburgring also had its front and rear apron, front spoiler, front and rear lid as well as the mudguards and diffuser including the aerodynamic fins made using this regenerative material. Body parts made from renewable raw materials The Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 Clubsport MR tackled this year's Nurburgring 24hour race in September featuring a complete body kit made of natural-fibre composite materials for the first time. Since early 2019, Porsche has been manufacturing the doors and rear wing of the small series racing vehicle out of a natural-fibre mix, sourced primarily from renewable raw materials. The vehicle that raced at the Nurburgring also had its front and rear apron, front spoiler, front and rear lid as well as the mudguards and diffuser including the aerodynamic fins made using this regenerative material. In terms of weight and stiffness, the recyclable natural-fibre composite materials of non-structural components share properties similar to carbon-fibre composites (CFRP) and meet the same high safety and quality standards Natural-fibre composites can also be manufactured more economically and with less energy. The 718 Cayman GT4 Clubsport MR faced a tough test on the Nurburgring but finished in second place in the alternative engine class. PORSCHE 718 CAYMAN GT4 CLUBSPORT MR WITH BODY COMPONENTS MADE FROM RENEWABLE RAW MATERIALS Hans Herrmann and Timo Bernhard meet in Le Mans The 24 Hours of Le Mans was postponed from June to September this year due to the global pandemic.

The first hybrid Porsche rolled off the production line in Leipzig in 2010. It was a Cayenne S Hybrid. Porsche was to become a pioneer in the introduction of innovative technologies. Sustainable acquisition of raw materials Porsche joined the Responsible Mica Initiative (RMI) cross-industry coalition in October. Mica are mineral mica pigments. They are used in a range of industrial and cosmetic products  and also in car paint. The coalition of international companies and non-governmental organisations founded in 2017 aims to ensure that the raw material mica is handled transparently and sustainably, thereby improving the living conditions of people in the extraction areas, for example through fair working conditions, health and safety measures and a minimum wage. Porsche represents the Volkswagen Group in the RMI. Ten years of hybrid production in Leipzig The first hybrid Porsche rolled off the production line in Leipzig in 2010. It was a Cayenne S Hybrid. Porsche was to become a pioneer in the introduction of innovative technologies. One year later, production of the Panamera S Hybrid was launched, also in Leipzig. In total, the plant has built more than 75,000 of these hybrid models to date. Stuttgart to get a Porsche Design Tower In October, representatives from Porsche, Porsche Design and property developer Bulow AG laid the symbolic foundation stone for the Porsche Design Tower and Porsche Centre in Stuttgart. It is the first joint project involving these three partners. The project is being built on a site measuring 8,500 square meters directly at the Pragsattel, an important traffic hub in the city of Stuttgart. With its height of around 90 metres, the Porsche Design Tower will be one of the tallest buildings in Stuttgart and, together with the Porsche Centre, will form a striking architectural feature. The design of the new structure will take its inspiration from the Destination Porsche concept that is used for all Porsche Centres across the world. The plan is for Porsches Stuttgart branch to relocate from Zuffenhausen to the Pragsattel in the middle of 2022. Kjell Gruner heads Porsche Cars North America Dr. Kjell Gruner has been President and CEO of Porsche Cars North America since November.

The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212213. Porsche Unseen: Unreleased concept cars In November, under the title Porsche Unseen, Porsche published design studies that had previously been kept under lock and key. In this way, the company is offering an exclusive insight into its design process  from the very first drawing to the finished model ready for series production. The Porsche Newsroom has pre sented 15 different cars from the period 2005 to 2019 in a series of articles. The 9:11 Magazine web TV format has also dedicated an episode to selected studies. Porsche Chief Designer Michael Mauer examined the connection between the studies and the current production models. A book entitled Porsche Unseen has also been published by the Delius Klasing publishing house. A selection of studies will be on display at a later stage for fans to admire up close: the Porsche Museum will be integrating a selection into its exhibition in 2021. Lutz Meschke becomes Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the HHL Porsche announced in November that Lutz Meschke would be taking up the position of Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Leipzig Graduate School of Management (HHL) with effect from 1 January 2021. Meschke is Deputy Chairman of the Executive Board and Member of the Executive Board for Finance and IT at Porsche AG. He has sat on the Supervisory Board of the HHL since 2013.

The Objective of the FlexFactory: to bring innovation and new variants onto the market more quickly, more efficiently and with less upfront investment. Jens Brucker takes over from Christian Friedl in Zuffenhausen Jens Brucker took over as the head of Porsches main factory in Zuffenhausen in the middle of November. Brucker succeeds Christian Friedl, who will manage the Seat plant in Martorell near Barcelona as of 1 January, 2021, after 20 years at Porsche. Brucker was previously responsible for managing the Volkswagen plant in South Africa where he spent more than four years, and before that he was employed by Daimler AG. Andre Lotterer writes Formula E history In their debut season racing in the ABB FIA Formula E champsionship in 2019/2020, the TAG Heuer Porsche Formula E team began writing Formula E history from their very first race in Diriyah in Saudi-Arabia: Andre Lotterer, driving a Porsche 99X Electric, claimed second spot in November. He went on to gain two more podium finishes, as well as one pole position, and finished in the points a further six times. No rookie team has achieved a podium finish in their first race since the inaugural season in 2014/2015. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212213. GTLM class: Seven victories in seven years The North American IMSA series was brought to an end with the double victory of the Porsche 911 RSR at the 12 Hours of Sebring race in November. The results in this class speak for themselves, with seven victories in seven years in the IMSA series and five wins in the North American Endurance Cup. Double victory for the GT team at the WEC The Porsche GT Team ended the season at the sports car World Endurance Championship (WEC) in November in Bahrain with a double victory. Porsche secured the runner-up spot in the constructor's championship ranking in the GTE PRO category, behind Aston Martin. Private Porsche GT teams were successful in many race series: Rowe Racings first place in the 24-hour race at Spa-Francorchamps in October and the SSR Performance teams overall victory in the ADAC GT Masters in November were both outstanding results. A 911 Carrera S for Gijs van Lennep Racing driver Gijs van Lennep was presented with a 911 Carrera S built specially for him in mid-November. The car was Porsche Netherlands tribute to the driver, whose career is closely interwoven with Porsche. The most eye-catching element of this special 911 is Gijs van Lenneps fingerprint on the bonnet. Gijs van Lennep was one of the best racing drivers in the world. He won the 24 Hours of Le Mans twice, driving a Porsche 911 with Helmut Marko in 1971 and then with Jacky Ickx in a 936 in 1976. He also scored points in Formula One, and was European Formula 5000 champion in 1972. In 1973, together with Herbert Muller, van Lennep won the Targa Florio in a 911 Carrera RSR. The race was the last staging of the legendary Sicilian road race and formed part of the sports car world championship. In 1999, van Lennep was voted the best Dutch racing driver of the twentieth century. Porsche Experience Centre to be opened in Tokyo The decision on the location of the ninth Porsche Experience Centre (PEC) was made in November. It will be built in Japan in the Chiba prefecture neighbouring Tokyo, with the opening scheduled for 2021. The new PEC Tokyo will be equipped with a circuit track, a dynamics area and an off-road track. The 2.1 km circuit track reproduces famous corners from racetracks around the world, such as the Karussell (Carousel) from the Nurburgring in Germany and the Laguna Seca corkscrew in the United States. A specific feature of PEC Tokyo will be its undulating 3D track to take advantage of the natural topography. The building and interior will be designed in a Japanese style. 53-year-old Targa perfectly restored The first Porsche 911 S Targa delivered in Germany is back on the road 53 years on and after extensive workshop restoration. The rare soft-window version with a soft rear window instead of a glass pane was delivered by the sports car manufacturer to the Porsche dealer Hulpert in Dortmund in January 1967. Today, the car is owned by a collector and Porsche enthusiast who tracked the Targa down in the United States, locating it under a plastic tarpaulin in an unlocked garage. It is said to have been sitting there for 40 years and was in a terrible condition. The work carried out by the experts from Porsche Classic in Zuffenhausen was correspondingly complex and took more than three years. Now, however, the Targa is as good as new, complete with charming patina. After 1,000 hours of work on the vehicles body, it was hand-painted in Polo Red. Because the car is also intended to be driven, a paint protection film with a light matt finish was also applied. Taycan drifts into the record books In November, the Porsche Taycan entered the Guinness World RecordsTM for the longest drift with an electric vehicle. The world record was set at the Porsche Experience Centre (PEC) Hockenheimring. Porsche instructor Dennis Retera drove 210 laps on the 200 metre-long drift circle without the front wheels ever pointing in the same direction as the curve. After 55 minutes the sideways expert had covered the classic marathon distance of 42.171 kilometres. The vehicles average speed was 46 km/h. The record was achieved with the rear-wheel drive version of the Taycan. Porsche invests in Berlin start-up VAHA Porsche Ventures invested in the Berlinbased company VAHA in late November. This start-up makes interactive exercise mirrors for use during home workouts or relaxation sessions. Artificial intelligence analyses every movement in the mirrors field of vision so that real-time corrections can be implemented. The tool currently offers more than 500 workouts on demand, from cardio and strength workouts to yoga. Alternatively, live courses can also be booked together with other participants, or even one-on-one personal training sessions. Porsche Ventures had already invested in the American start-up Playbook back in October. Playbook operates a digital fitness platform. PERFECTLY RESTORED TARGA The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212213. Racing driver Walter Lechner has died Porsche racing driver Walter Lechner passed away on 8 December 2020 at the age of 71. The Austrian from Faistenau in the Salzkammergut region had been a valued member of the Porsche family since 1985. Lechnergained his maiden victory at the Osterreich-ring when racing for the first time at the wheel of a private Porsche 956. During his successful career spanning more than two decades, the racing driver won two titles in the Interserie driving Group C vehicles from Porsche and also contested the 24 Hours of Le Mans. After hanging up his racing helmet in 1996 aged 47, Walter Lechner established a successful motorsport company. Today, Lechner Racing is managed by his sons Robert and Walter Jnr. With a total of eleven team titles, Lechner Racing is the most successful team in the history of the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup. By investing in the worlds first commercial integrated eFuels plant, Porsche is supporting the development of alternative fuels. eFuels are a sensible addition to electromobility and make a further contribution to climate protection. Creation of site fire service in Zuffenhausen The main plant in Zuffenhausen is to be given a site fire service, as announced by Porsche in mid-December. This marks the companys response to the huge expansion of its main site over recent years. The goal is to make a further, significant improvement to the protection of employees, buildings and facilities. Another reason is the increased use of highvoltage components. The firefighters are specially trained for emergency operations of this kind. The plan is for the new site fire brigade to reach squadron strength (six fire fighters) while on duty. 35 full-time firefighters are to be employed. By 2023, the Zuffenhausen plant will have its own fire station in a central location. Until then, an interim building will be used as a fire station. To date, the Stuttgart professional fire brigade has been responsible for the Zuffenhausen plant. Porsches Weissach and Leipzig sites have each already had their own fire service for several years. Funding for eFuels pilot project At the beginning of December, the German Federal Government announced funding of around eight million euros for the eFuels pilot project in Chile. Together with Siemens Energy and a number of international companies, Porsche AG is developing and implementing synthetic, virtually climate-neutral fuels (eFuels). The Haru Oni Pilot Plant in the province of Magallanes takes advantage of the excellent wind conditions in southern Chile to produce climate-neutral fuel using green wind power. Siemens Energy is receiving the funding as part of the national hydrogen strategy. During the pilot phase, the plan is for around 130,000 litres of eFuels to be produced per year from 2022 onwards. Production is then to be increased to 550 million litres by 2026. As the main buyer of the fuel, Porsche wants to use eFuels in motorsport, in its Porsche Experience Centres and, potentially, also in production sports cars. The company is investing around 20 million euros in the project. eFuels are easy to use and are suitable for combustion engines as well as plug-in hybrids. They also make use of the existing filling station network. By investing in the worlds first commercial integrated eFuels plant, Porsche is supporting the development of alternative fuels. eFuels are a sensible addition to electromobility and make a further contribution to climate protection. Even more spectacular: The new 911 GT3 Cup In December, Porsche presented the latest generation of the world's best-selling racing car: the new 911 GT3 Cup. This vehicle is also designed to run on synthetic fuels, enabling a significant reduction in CO2. The new GT3 Cup features a turbocharged body and puts out 510 hp. Depending on the respective track profile, lap times are expected to improve by a good one per cent. From the start of the 2021 season, it will compete in the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup as well as in the national Porsche Carrera Cups in Germany, France, Asia and the Benelux  and for the first time also in North America. The first 911 Cup car was presented in 1990. Since then, five further generations have followed and a total of 4,251 units have been produced. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212 213. Artificial intelligence detects background noise Porsche Digital has expanded its product portfolio to include the digital assistant Sounce. This software can detect background noise, for example, during vehicle component tests. The underlying technology uses deep learning methods. The assistant documents errors in precise detail and simplifies root cause analysis. This takes the strain off development engineers, improves quality and cuts costs. Sounce is a collaboration between Porsche Digital and the development department of Porsche AG. The product is available in the form of a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). New customers through online sales Being able to order a Porsche while sitting at home on the sofa  following its online presence on the German market, Porsche also activated this service in December for customers in Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Italy, France, Poland, Slovenia and Estonia. The UK and further markets are set to be added in 2021. E-commerce offers huge potential. In Italy, 40 per cent of online shoppers are new customers. In addition to the rollout in Europe and activities in the United States, customers in China have also been able to buy used vehicles from Porsche dealers via WeChat since autumn. Porsche China offers lifestyle products and online driving experiences via its new Porsche flagship store on Tmall, China's largest B2C online marketplace. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DETECTS BACKGROUND NOISE E-commerce offers huge potential. In Italy, 40 per cent of online shoppers are new customers. The latest from the Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur Since December, the Porsche Car Configurator has been offering individuality down to the smallest detail. The colours of the vehicle key, key case, floor mats and on-board folder can be selected in real time on the configurator according to the customers tastes and personal preferences. In 2021, it will also be possible to select the colour for logos and lettering. The Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur wants to offer customers maximum scope for design and personalisation. The customers can become the designers. The Manufaktur also produces limited small series and editions. High-quality materials are combined with the latest manufacturing techniques to create a coherent overall concept. Warming up for the 2021 racing season With its first virtual Night of Champions on 12 December, Porsche began the warm-up for the 2021 racing season. Porsche Motorsport Director Fritz Enzinger declared his support for continued participation in ABB FIA Formula E: We firmly believe in the excellent stage and the unique concept. We use purely electric formula racing for consistent development work and to build on our expertise in battery electric drives. The TAG Heuer Porsche Formula E team will start the new season with works drivers Andre Lotterer (Germany, car number 36) and Pascal Wehrlein (Germany, car number 99) in the Porsche 99X Electric. The backup drivers, both from Switzerland, are Simona de Silvestro and Neel Jani. In the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC), Porsche continues to field two 911 RSR with around 515 hp. The two cars will compete in all six races with a slightly different driver team in cooperation with Manthey Racing. In the number 91 car, Italian Gianmaria Bruni and Austrian Richard Lietz will again take turns behind the wheel. In the sister car, with number 92, the 2016 World Endurance Champion Neel Jani will drive alongside Kevin Estre from France. Green light for LMDh prototype The Executive Board at Porsche AG gave the green light for the development of an LMDh prototype in December. Porsche Motorsport received the order to build a vehicle based on future regulations. From 2023, the LMDh cars will make up a new top class in the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) and the North American IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. Both championships are hugely significant for the Stuttgart sports car manufacturer. Porsche very much welcomed the introduction of the new class for hybrid prototypes. The racing cars, which tip the scales at around 1,000 kilograms, are powered by a hybrid system with an output of 500 kW (680 hp). Endurance racing is part of our brands DNA, explained Oliver Blume, CEO at Porsche AG. The new LMDh category will allow Porsche to fight for overall victories with a hybrid system at the Le Mans, Daytona and Sebring classics  without breaking the bank. LMDh stands for Le Mans Daytona Hybrid. Drive housing from a 3D printer In December, Porsche produced a complete housing for an electric drive using a 3D printer for the first time. In so doing, the engineers behind this development proved their point, namely that the additive laser melting process can also be used for relatively large, highly stressed components of an electric sports car. The alloy housing passed all of the quality and load tests. It weighs less and cuts the overall weight of the drive by around ten per cent. At the same time, the rigidity in heavily loaded areas is doubled, with considerably reduced assembly time. The optimised e-drive would be ideal for use in a super sports car with a low production run. Especially for special and small series as well as for motorsport, this production technology is an attractive prospect both technically and economically. Newly printed pistons with an innovative design have previously passed their acid test in the 911 GT2 RS high-performance sports car. BUSINESS PERFORMANCE Global economy in reverse gear The robust growth of earlier years came to an abrupt halt in 2020. The global economy shifted into reverse gear, with a negative growth rate of minus 4 per cent (2019: +2.6 per cent). The global coronavirus pandemic and resulting impact on supply and demand were the key contributory factors. The average rate of growth in gross domestic product (GDP) was well down on the previous year in both the developed economies and the emerging markets. Governments and central banks across the world responded with fiscal and monetary policy measures, and interest rates fell even further. On average, consumer prices rose more slowly worldwide than in 2019. GDP in Western Europe was down 7.2 per cent (2019: +1.3 per cent). In addition to the impact of the pandemic, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit was a further negative factor as the UK negotiated its exit from the European Union (EU). In Germany, consumer and business confidence picked up gradually over the course of the year. However, economic output for 2020 was down by 5.3 per cent (2019: +0.6 per cent). GDP in the economies of Central and Eastern Europe also fell considerably in the reporting year, down by 3.7 per cent (2019: +2.5 per cent). The situation in Russia was much the same, with a fall of 4.1 per cent (2019: +1.3 per cent). US economic output for 2020 was down by 3.6 per cent (2019: +2.2 per cent), with a doubling in the unemployment rate to more than 8 per cent. In neighbouring Canada, GDP decreased by 5.7 per cent (2019: +1.9 per cent), while the fall in Mexico was 9.0 per cent (2019: 0). Brazils economy shrank by 4.6 per cent (2019: +1.4 per cent). In Argentina, the economy continued to contract, but at a much higher rate than before, with a fall of 11.1 per cent (2019: -2.1 per cent). The Chinese economy was exposed to the negative impact of the pandemic earlier in 2020 than other countries but subsequently benefited from a relatively low number of new infections as the year went on. GDP recorded a net increase of 2.3 per cent (2019: +6.1 per cent). In Japan, economic output for 2020 fell by 5.4 per cent (2019: +0.3 per cent). Performance of car markets In 2020, the global automobile market shrank compared with the previous year for the third year in a row. The contraction during the reporting year amounted to 15.2 per cent, resulting in a total of 67.7 million new cars. Total new car registrations in Western Europe fell by almost a quarter (-24.5 per cent) compared with the previous year, to 10.9 million vehicles. The negative impact of the spread of coronavirus could be felt in all countries in this region from March 2020 onwards. New registrations remained in negative territory despite the recovery that took effect in the second half of the year. With sales of 2.9 million units, a drop of 19.1 per cent, Germany performed somewhat better than the UK (-29.4 per cent), France (-25.4 per cent), Italy (-27.9 per cent) and Spain (-32.1 per cent). In North America, the sales of passenger vehicles and light commercial vehicles (up to 6.35 tons) decreased by 15.9 per cent to 17.1 million units. The US market also contracted by 14.5 per cent to 14.6 million units. Here, the drop affected the passenger vehicle segment more severely (-26.8 per cent) than light commercial vehicles, which includes pick-ups (-9.8 per cent). The reduction in new registrations in Canada was even more marked at -19.7 per cent. In Mexico the market shrank by 28.0 per cent, while there was a similar picture in Brazil (-26.7 per cent). The passenger vehicle market in the Asia Pacific region amounted to 30.9 million units in the reporting year, 9.6 per cent below the previous years total. Here, China recorded a drop of 6.5 per cent to 19.9 million vehicles, and the Japanese market witnessed a decrease in demand of 11.2 per cent, to 3.8 million cars. The global economy shifted into reverse gear, with a negative growth rate of minus 4 per cent (2019: +2.6 per cent). The global coronavirus pandemic and resulting impact on supply and demand were the key contributory factors. GDP in Western Europe was down 7.2 per cent (2019: +1.3 per cent). In Germany, consumer and business confidence picked up gradually over the course of the year. However, economic output for 2020 was down by 5.3 per cent (2019: +0.6 per cent). Economic growth Percentage change in GDP 2.3% China 0% 3.6% US 4.0% Global economy 5.3% Germany 7.2% Western Europe Important events 2020  Robust result for deliveries Porsche profited operatively from its strong global organisation in 2020: the sports car manufacturer delivered a total of 272,162 vehicles over the course of the year. The stable result is just three per cent below the figure for the record year 2019 and exceeds the sales achieved in 2018 by just under 16,000 vehicles. This means that the year under review is the second most successful in the companys history  in spite of the coronavirus crisis. A young and attractive product range, the successful launch of the all-electric Porsche Taycan and the powerful charisma of the brand provide the foundation for this success. A total of 20,015 Taycan cars were delivered in 2020  in spite of the production shutdown. However, the vehicles positive momentum could be maintained by means of flexible measures, for example for market premieres. Most Taycan cars were delivered to the US, equivalent to 4,414 vehicles. The company had started deliveries of the first all-electric Porsche in December 2019. The second-strongest Taycan market was the Northern Europe region including Benelux and Austria, accounting for 3,604 vehicles, followed by Germany with 3,294 units. However, Taycan sales only started over the course of 2020 in most markets. The Cayenne enjoyed the highest demand worldwide, with 92,860 units delivered and an increase of one per cent compared with the previous year. A third of the vehicles delivered were the Coupe model. The two-door sports cars were also very popular with customers. A total of 21,784 units of the 718 models were delivered  six per cent more than in the previous year. The sports car icon Porsche 911 was handed over to customers 34,328 times. 78,124 Macan vehicles were delivered, along with 25,051 Panamera vehicles. The E-Hybrid Cayenne and Panamera models were again in high demand. Around a quarter of the Cayenne and Panamera vehicles worldwide were delivered as this variant. Globally, 10 per cent of all Porsche cars delivered are now Plug-In Hybrids. A total of 17 per cent of all new vehicles now have an electric drive; this share is even around one third in Europe. The highest-volume Porsche market remains China with 88,968 vehicles delivered  an increase of three per cent compared with 2019. The Asia-Pacific, Africa and Middle East region also continued to develop positively overall: 121,641 vehicles were delivered there, equivalent to an increase of four per cent compared with the same period in the previous year. Steady demand in the coronavirus year 2020 Due to the coronavirus crisis, 2020 was a very challenging year for the Porsche sales organisation. Many dealerships worldwide had to close temporarily in the spring. At the end of the year, there was a renewed lockdown in some markets. Demand recovered noticeably over the course of the year in other countries, and in some cases, there was even year-on-year growth. It was therefore possible to partly make up for the downward trends in the first quarter. This meant that the performance of Porsche was therefore a robust overall one in terms of the delivery results. Porsche profited operatively from its strong global organisation in 2020: the sports car manufacturer delivered a total of 272,162 vehicles over the course of the year. The stable result is just three per cent below the figure for the record year 2019 and exceeds the sales achieved in 2018 by just under 16,000 vehicles.

Asia China: Undisputed leader In 2020, China was undisputedly the largest single market for Porsche. This was in spite of almost all dealerships being closed in February. However, demand picked up again rapidly afterwards. Deliveries had almost reached the same level as the previous year in China by the start of the summer. Porsche delivered a total of 88,968 vehicles there in the year as a whole. This represents an increase of three per cent compared with 2019.

OUTLOOK World economy en route to recovery Our planning is based on the assumption that global economic output will recover on the whole this year. We believe that the effects of the pandemic can be stemmed sustainably in 2021. The anticipated level of growth will probably not be sufficient to return the country to its 2019 GDP level, however. We consider protectionist tendencies, potential turbulence on the financial markets and structural deficits in some countries to be a source of risk. At the same time, growth prospects are being kept in check by ongoing geopolitical tension and conflict. Nevertheless, we believe that both developed economies and emerging markets will register positive movements in economic output. According to our forecasts, economic growth in Western Europe will strengthen significantly in 2021. This will also be true for Germany. Similarly, we anticipate growth in Central and Eastern Europe, but on the basis of surveys expect only a moderate expansion in the Russian economy. For the United States we forecast that unemployment will fall but remain high. Overall, the economy there should improve considerably. We also anticipate a rise in economic output in neighbouring Canada and Mexico. Our forecast for the Brazilian economy is for a strong growth rate. Meanwhile, in Argentina we do not expect any improvement in the economic situation following three years of declining GDP. Our calculations show that the Chinese economy will continue to grow at a relatively fast pace in 2021. In Japan we expect economic output to increase a little. Positive growth of car markets According to our forecasts, demand in the worlds passenger car markets will increase overall in 2021. This is based on the assumption that the pandemic can be contained on a lasting basis. We anticipate that new registrations in Western Europe will rise significantly in 2021. This will be the case for all of the major markets, i.e. Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain and France. Passenger car markets in Central and Eastern Europe will also record notable growth, we believe. We expect that demand in the markets for passenger vehicles and light commercial vehicles (up to 6.35 tons) in North America and the United States in particular will increase considerably compared with the previous year. Furthermore, the highest demand is expected for vehicles in the SUV and pick-up segments. We also expect sales to increase in Canada and Brazil. Passenger car markets in the Asia Pacific region are expected to be noticeably above the previous years level in 2021. We anticipate that demand in China will also clearly exceed the previous years figure. Good-value, entry-level SUV models in particular can be expected to remain very popular. The market in Japan is also expected to improve slightly in 2021 on the whole. According to our forecasts, demand for passengervehicles is set to rise across all of the major markets this year. As far as Europe is concerned, this relates to Germany, the UK, Italy and France, and it also applies to the USA and China. This is contingent on a sustained improvement in the situation with regard to the pandemic. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212213. PORSCHE STRATEGY 2030 Porsche  A brand for those who follow their dreams A strategy leads to success when it is recalibrated over and over, and flexibly adapted to new parameters. In this way, a strategy, and its common thread, can be continuously developed. And that is exactly what we have done: Strategy 2030 replaced Strategy 2025 Plus at the end of the financial year. Why? The world is changing at breakneck speed. It is becoming more digital, more connected and also more volatile. The automotive sector is undergoing a complete transformation. Digitalisation and new technologies are affecting almost all areas of life and every economic sector. This is inevitably changing markets and what customers need. Working environments are growing ever more complex. At the same time, new ways of thinking and new processes are developing in a range of areas, driven by climate change. Porsche is looking ahead. We are embracing the huge challenges as opportunities. We are proactively shaping our future. And the new Strategy 2030 is a clear expression of this mindset. The path to the new strategy 2016: At a time of huge technological upheaval, Chairman of the Executive Board Oliver Blume presented the Strategy 2025, with its focus on the sports car of the future. The key themes were electrification, digitalisation and innovation. One outstanding result is the Taycan. Porsches first all-electric sports car highlights the extent to which product strategy is geared towards electromobility. The Taycan is produced in the new factory in Zuffenhausen in a CO2-neutral process. This marks a first in Porsches history and underscores the companys commitment to the Paris climate goals. The second stage followed in 2019 with a further sharpening of the strategy, and with Porsche focusing even more closely on current trends. These included growing urbanisation, artificial intelligence, automated driving and the rising importance of data protection and data security. The Strategy 2025 Plus involved the further development of the existing strategic aims. In particular, the crosscutting issues of product, sustainability and innovation were to be tackled to an even greater extent across the different functions. Aview into the future Now, in the form of its Strategy 2030, the company is taking the next step. Preparations are based around this question: How will the world of sports car and exclusive mobility develop in future? Porsche has used three scenarios to move closer to the next decade, and thought its ideas through to their logical conclusion. In the Digital Frontiers scenario, even more areas of life will be digitalised. Health, education and shopping: more and more of the things we do every day are happening in the virtual world. Digital ecosystems with products and services are vying for customers. Privacy and personalisation are becoming increasingly important. Trust is becoming the critical currency. Companies that succeed in building trusting networks with a strong brand will be the winners in this world. The Equilibrium Race scenario highlights how climate change is changing peoples views and values. Zero waste is becoming the guiding principle in all that we do. The trailblazers are the companies with the most sustainable technology. Individual mobility is becoming less important. Alongside public transport, numerous mobility services are gaining a foothold, especially in urban areas. The third scenario, Game of Cities, models life in megacities. There were already more than 38 of these cities in 2019, and their number is rising. This fragmented world of sprawling cities developing at different rates presents us with major challenges, not least dense traffic flows and an environmental impacts. Individual space is becoming more valuable. Mobility must be reorganised. Using the scenario technique, Porsche can prepare for the most diverse challenges of the future. Mission 2030 In the beginning, I looked around and could not find quite the car I dreamed of. So I decided to build it myself. With this quote, trailblazer Ferry Porsche set the tone for the future. It is now more than 70 years since he built the 356 and created the Porsche sports car brand. Since then, his words have lost none of their appeal. Quite the opposite, in fact. His quote perfectly describes the mission with which the company is shaping its future. Vision 2030 The companys new vision carries Ferry Porsche s mindset into the future. Porsche  A brand for those who follow their dreams. This explicitly includes the employees. Chairman of the Executive Board Oliver Blume adds, Porsche epitomises freedom and independence  and the inner drive to achieve goals. To this day, nothing has changed in that regard. At Porsche, we want to help our customers realise their lifelong dreams. Goals 2030 Porsche has defined its goals for the four stakeholder groups: customers, society, employees and investors. In keeping with this vision, the company aims to be the most recognised brand and one that particularly excites its customers. Sustainability is now an even bigger priority. Porsche assumes responsibility for society and is striving to become carbon-neutral as soon as possible, across the entire value chain. The companys successful future depends on happy employees. The company wants to keep on being an outstanding employer. Porsche is facing up to the major financial challenges of the present day. The company is investing heavily in such areas as innovation, digitalisation and training. Despite this necessary financial effort, Porsche is sticking to its strategic target of a return on sales of 15 per cent. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212213. Mission 2030 In the beginning, I looked around and could not find quite the car I dreamed of. So I decided to build it myself. Photo: Ferry Porsche (left) with his son Ferdinand Alexander Goals 2030 STRATEGY HOUSE Six cross-cutting strategies Customer, products, sustainability, digitalisation, organisation and transformation: these are the six cross-cutting elements that make up the Porsche Strategy 2030. These topics are managed by cross-functional teams in close collaboration with the Executive Board. They form the centre of the Porsche strategy house and feed into the corporate goals. The results programme provides the foundation. Porsche uses this to increase efficiencies and to tap into additional sources of income. The second foundation stone is the Volkswagen Groups Together4Integrity (T4I) programme, which aims to bolster the Groups integrity and compliance across all brands and companies. These are of equal importance to such factors as sales, earnings, product quality or employer attractiveness as longterm strategic and operational performance indicators. The cross-sectional Customer strategy focuses on the relationship with our customers. Premium customer experiences should further boost customer loyalty and attract new audiences to the Porsche brand. Omni-channel sales and the development of a strong Porsche community are designed to connect customers with the brand online and in the physical world. The Products cross-cutting strategy focuses on the customer requirements of the future, consistently aligning product strategy with digital, networked and innovative products and services. In addition to the core business, individual mobility solutions and financial services should also contribute to corporate profitability. The Sustainability cross-cutting strategy defines and focuses on specific priorities for sustainability at Porsche. These extend from ecological and social aspects to responsible corporate governance. Decarbonisation and maintaining a circular economy along the entire value chain are key. We are also pushing for sustainability in the supply chain and strengthening our social commitment with the aim of empowering and educating members of society. The Digitalisation cross-cutting strategy focuses on building up the companys own digital skills and involving strategic partners in order to accelerate change. Shortening the time-to-market for products and business models, an open-platform strategy, and the use of artificial intelligence and data-driven optimisations should make a major contribution to the business result. The Organisation cross-cutting strategy relates to the future, organisational alignment of Porsche. The goal is to tackle todays fields of activity as effectively and efficiently as possible. We define the strategic value creation fields that we will work on within our own organisation in the future and that will be covered in the context of strategic partnerships or by external suppliers. We want to establish Porsche as an innovation leader in the areas that matter most to us. The focus of the Transformation crosscutting strategy is on people. The aim is to provide new ways and methods of working and to empower employees to face future challenges. Leadership has a central role to play in this regard: informing employees about changes at an early stage, involving them in the relevant processes, and motivating them to drive the change forward together. This new form of leadership inspires employees to act with entrepreneurial spirit and is geared towards a long-term vision and goals. THE VIEW INTO THE FUTURE IS ALWAYS TINGED WITH UNCERTAINTY. THATS EXACTLY WHY ITS IMPORTANT FOR THE STRATEGY TO GUIDE US AND CONNECT THE MAJOR ISSUES TO SPECIFIC COMPANY AIMS. THE STRATEGY 2030 PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT BASIS FOR THIS. WE ARE MOVING IN A CLEAR DIRECTION, WE HAVE THE TOOLS WE NEED, AND WE KNOW TO BE FLEXIBLE. WE MUST TAKE THE FUTURE INTO OUR OWN HANDS. Oliver Blume, Chairman of the Executive Board SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT Sustainability strategy Sustainability organisation Sustainable Development Goals SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT In the reporting year, Porsche approved its Strategy 2030, further developing its strategic focus on sustainability. The company is reviewing the entire value chain with a view to improving sustainability at all levels of its commercial activities, against the backdrop of global challenges. With the sustainability focus of Strategy 2030, Porsche is pursuing its long-term objective of achieving meaningful growth in economic benefit and social responsibility while reducing the ecological footprint of its business. Sustainability strategy Businesses are key participants in society. Commercial activities have a diverse range of social, economic and ecological impacts. As employers and economic actors, however, companies also depend on the acceptance and well-being of society. The coronavirus pandemic made this dependency particularly tangible during the reporting year. Society rightly demands that businesses meet their obligations and are accountable and put their power behind universal concerns. Every year more resources are consumed around the world than can be naturally produced. The planets population will grow to over eight billion people by 2030. Companies are operating in a new economic context shaped by global competition for resources, the threat of climate change, political upheaval and the global consequences of the pandemic, rampant consumer demand, and the changing views and standards of a range of interest groups in relation to sustainable development. The automotive industry is especially affected by this. It is facing major change and new challenges. The new Porsche sustainability Strategy 2030 identifies the principal challenges for the company in six strategy fields that are key to the sports car manufacturers sustainable development. These action areas provide a consistent focus for Porsches activities. The impact of business activity and of societys expectations for the company are always at the core. With its strategy fields, Porsche is meeting global risks head-on while simultaneously embracing new opportunities to influence and innovate, in collaboration with its suppliers, employees and customers, across the entire value chain of the business. Porsche organises its sustainability activities on the basis of the following six strategy fields: DECARBONISATION CIRCULAR ECONOMY DIVERSITY PARTNER-TO-SOCIETY SUPPLY CHAIN RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE & TRANSPARENCY Progress on this journey is subject to regular evaluation and the strategy is continually updated to secure the best possible outcomes. Porsche also engages actively with its internal and external stakeholders as well as with recognised experts such as the members of the Porsche Sustainability Council. With ambitious aims, the Porsche Sustainability Strategy 2030 is measured against scientific findings and external expectations that create the framework for effective action. The company is also drawing on its inherent values and the brands calling to be a bold and visionary pioneer of sustainable mobility. Porsche seeks to shape its future responsibly and successfully, with and for society. The new strategy fields underscore Porsches commitment to focusing on sustainability in its entirety. Indirect effects of the companys business activities, including in the supply chain, are given the same level of attention as direct, operational impacts. In this way, Porsche is living up to its responsibility along the companys entire value chain. *The chapters in the Sustainability section of this report are organised according to the reporting areas Innovative Mobility, Reliable Partner and Go to Zero in line with the previous reporting period. Due to the new strategic direction undertaken in the reporting year, Porsche is in a process of transformation that will also shape the form of future sustainability reporting. Strategy areas in Porsches Sustainability Strategy 2030 DECARBONISATION CIRCULAR ECONOMY DIVERSITY PARTNER-TO-SOCIETY SUPPLY CHAIN RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE & TRANSPARENCY Sustainability organisation GRI 102-43 Sustainability is anchored as a central crosscutting issue in the Porsche Strategy 2030. The Chairman of the Executive Board is directly responsible for this topic, with additional support from the Member of the Executive Board for Production and Logistics and the Member of the Executive Board for Procurement. Porsches sustainability organisation is implemented across the entire Group. A transparent internal structure with defined roles and responsibilities allows sustainability topics to be handled consistently and effectively throughout the business. This is underpinned by the Group Sustainability Directive. The Directive contains binding rules on organisational processes, topic management, project implementation, and communication of all sustainability topics. The Executive Board of Porsche AG acts as the highest authority on sustainability. It regularly meets in the context of Board Strategy Workshops and sets the fundamental strategic direction as well as specific targets for sustainability. It also decides on the realisation of far-reaching sustainability measures and lighthouse projects. During the reporting year, a new Sustainability department was created within the General Secretary and Corporate Development division with responsibility for the sustainability strategy, its implementation and its continued development. The department is also responsible for carrying out sustainability projects and managing the companys sustainability bodies. In line with the Volkswagen Group Sustainability Guidelines, the Sustainability department is the interface with the Volkswagen Group, where it represents the Porsche brands sustainability management. In addition, the Politics and Society department of the Communications, Sustainability and Politics division is responsible for internal and external sustainability communications, non-financial reporting and the ongoing reinforcement of stakeholder dialogue and collaboration in sustainability networks. The Office of the Sustainability Council and the project management for all activities relating to the Value Balancing Alliance are also firmly embedded here. As a cross-departmental entity the Environment and Sustainability steering committee sets and consolidates the direction and content of the environment and sustainability strategy in preparation for its subsequent adoption by the Environment and Sustainability Steering Group and the Executive Board. The steering committee comprises representatives of all departments with relevance to sustainability. It focuses on matters relating to the environment and sustainability strategy, including decisions on the roadmap and objectives. The Environment and Sustainability steering committee also forms working groups to prepare, evaluate and refine topics, projects and initiatives relating to sustainability. It generally holds bimonthly meetings and reports regularly to the Steering Group above it. The Environment and Sustainability Steering Group is the ultimate instance in Porsche at which the focus and direction of the environment and sustainability strategy can be established in preparation for adoption by the Executive Board. The Steering Group is composed of the heads of the main divisions and can be expanded flexibly as required. It is concerned with all topics conducive to the development and creation of the environment and sustainability strategy, and commissions the Environment and Sustainability steering committee to prepare and agree topics, projects and initiatives relating to sustainability. The division of roles and responsibilities among the members of the Steering Group and participants in the topic areas is governed for both the Steering Group and the steering committee in accordance with the Porsche Group Sustainability Guidelines. The Environment and Sustainability Steering Group meets once each quarter and provides regular reports to the Executive Board.

The 17 global sustainability goals that have been defined are intended to reconcile economic progress with social justice and environmental compatibility. Porsche takes its responsibility seriously to counter the depletion of natural resources and climate change and make a positive impact on social development. The company is committed to the SDGs and is focusing its activities for sustainable development on the key topics that can make a tangible contribution through its own business model and associated value creation processes. Taking account of internal and external sources, there are seven SDGs to which Porsche can make a significant difference through its sustainability activities. SDG 4  Quality education For Porsche, education is a key to sustainable development. This is why the company offers its trainees and staff a diverse programme of vocational and professional training, All employees have access to systematic further development opportunities based on their needs. At its company sites as well as on the international stage, Porsche is also committed to a range of educational and scientific projects, including regional schemes in Stuttgart and Leipzig with the Ferry Porsche educates initiative, as well as the international Porsche Aftersales Vocational Education (PAVE) programme, which aims to provide and expand local vocational education for Porsches sales organisations as required around the world. SDG 8  Decent work and economic growth Porsche creates high quality jobs to create value and achieve sustainable growth, and affirms its commitment to observing and protecting human rights beyond the factory gates and throughout the supply chain. The sports car manufacturer therefore not only assumes responsibility for its employees and invests in their future. It also sets high, internationally recognised standards for social and human rights that must be met by its suppliers. In this way, Porsche provides effective support to the protection of humane working conditions and categorically rejects all forms of modern slavery, such as forced, mandatory and child labour. SDG 9  Industry, innovation and infrastructure Porsche is synonymous with innovative products and services. By expanding a high-performance charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, permanently working to find innovative solutions, and trialling digital technologies and future trends, the company is playing an instrumental role in sustainable development. The Taycan, Porsches first fully electric sports car, illustrates the mobility revolution. The new plant constructed for production of the Taycan in the companys traditional main Zuffenhausen works is also a good example. Here, Porsche has upgraded the entire site to make it CO2 neutral. SDG 11  Sustainable cities and communities The sports car production at the main plant in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen is located in a mixeduse zone, surrounded by residential areas. Consequently, the company is directly confronted with the challenges posed by increasing urbanisation of the planet. This is another reason why Porsche feels a sense of duty to actively contribute to the sustainable development of cities by providing smart solutions. Resource-efficient production processes and products, as well as technological and social innovation, are the key factors for the company in this regard. Porsche is putting all its energy into mobility that is fit for the future and is including forward-looking concepts such as sharing, rental and leasing concepts in its portfolio to make urban mobility more flexible. SDG 12  Responsible consumption and production Porsche not only works non-stop on products that are more environmentally and resourcefriendly, but also undertakes to make its manufacturing processes as efficient as possible and sparing on the environment. The ecological and social quality of processes is equally as important as the economic, functional and technical qualities. The company places the utmost value on compliance with international rules on employee, health and environmental protection. For this reason, ethical perspectives and standards are also written into the sustainability requirements that apply to the Porsche supply chain. SDG 13  Climate action Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. Porsche is embracing the challenge of pushing technological boundaries, reducing fuel consumption and developing innovative drive systems. The company is aiming for total decarbonisation and CO2 neutrality, in this way making a contribution to the achievment of the UN climate goals. Throughout the value chain, Porsche follows the principle of avoid, then reduce, then offset. Porsche accepts its responsibility for tackling the depletion of valuable resources, acting to stop climate change, and making a positive contribution to social development. The conservation of raw materials and energy is another huge priority. For example, the sports car manufacturer already obtains 100 per cent of its production electricity requirement from renewable sources and is also pushing ahead with additional climate protection projects at its individual sites. Porsche continually reduces the CO2 emissions of its own car fleet and offsets the CO2 emissions of its vehicle pool. As its development of electric models gathers pace, Porsche is not only making a contribution to global climate protection but is also helping to improve air quality in cities. SDG 17  Partnerships for the goals Sustainable mobility solutions and a future world that is worth living in can only be created by working together. This is why a process of permanent exchange with stakeholders and the strengthening of partnerships form the essential basis of Porsches sustainability strategy. The company is active in a number of networks including the German Environmental Management Association (B.A.U.M.) and the German Business Ethics Network (DNWE), and also engages in cross-industry sustainability initiatives such as the Value Balancing Alliance. Through this cooperation, Porsche supports knowledge transfer for innovative and relevant approaches from the perspective of sustainability and ensures that the needs of its own stakeholders are embedded and represented within the sustainability strategy.

Proactive engagement with stakeholder groups is particularly important to the company, and Porsche seeks to continually expand this dialogue. At Porsche, an open, transparent exchange of information and reasoned debate lay the foundation for mutual understanding and acceptance. Stakeholder management at Porsche takes a 360-degree approach that aims to systematically record the expectations of each stakeholder group and use this feedback as the basis for critical reflection on the strategic planning processes. By taking account of the interests and perspectives of various stakeholder groups, the company can quickly identify key social trends and incorporate these in its commercial decision-making. Looking outwards, the two-way sharing of information can reveal what scope for action Porsche sees in current challenges, and articulates the conditions and parameters that are important to the business. Stakeholder management tools An exchange that is beneficial for all sides must be based on trust. This is the core value of any long-term relationship between Porsche and its dialogue partners. Credible exchange with our stakeholders must be geared towards the long term and be nurtured on an ongoing basis. Porsche believes it is important for people to talk to one another, not over one another. The companys approach seeks to understand, to break down barriers and to foster long-term partnerships. It does this through a range of communication channels and formats for dialogue with both internal and external audiences. The most important sources of information for thought leaders, decision makers and customers include the Porsche magazine Christophorus, published in 13 languages around the world, the Newsroom with its Twitter and Instagram channels, the webbased TV channel 9:11 Magazine and the Porsche website. During the reporting year, the 9:11 podcast was added to this extensive range of channels, with both a German and an English-language version. Porsches employees also have many ways of contributing their own thoughts and ideas, as well as opportunities for interacting directly with technical managers. All internal communications are published in digital and printed formats through the Carrera media. A separate sustainability-focused Info World section on the Carrera Online pages on the intranet as well as feature articles on sustainability in the Carrera Magazine keep employees up to date with the latest developments. Regular works and departmental meetings, employee information events, and specific topic and innovation weeks also form part of the diverse programme of internal communications. Porsche seeks to establish personal contact through stakeholder engagement events, such as the regular Neighbourhood Dialogues that take part at the companys sites. Since 2016, these have given local residents the opportunity to raise specific issues with the experts directly. Unfortunately the extensive restrictions implemented as a result of the coronavirus pandemic have meant that the events planned for the reporting year have not been able to take place as normal. In response, Porsche has ramped up its online dialogue with key groups to obtain direct feedback and suggestions. Through a dedicated email address sustainability@porsche.com, the sports car manufacturer offers stakeholders a way of contacting the responsible department directly. Our stakeholders GRI 102-40, 102-42, 102-43, 102-44 At Porsche, an open, The most important company stakeholders (internal and external) transparent exchange as determined by internal analyses. of information and reasoned debate lay the foundation for mutual understanding and acceptance. Stakeholder management at Porsche takes a 360-degree approach that aims to systematically record the expectations of each stakeholder group and use this feedback as the basis for critical reflection on the strategic planning processes. Dialogue with politics Porsche operates in a complex and heavily regulated field. Its commercial decisions are influenced by numerous requirements, and the decision-making process must assess and take account of consequences for stakeholders. It is necessary to engage in transparent and proactive dialogue with governments, parliaments, authorities, associations, institutions and representatives of civic society through political lobbying to contribute to the environment in which the company undertakes its commercial activities. The Politics and Society department coordinates all political topics that are relevant to Porsche. It does this at all levels, whether local, regional, national or international. It is also responsible for the companys political lobbying. The Politics team works with associations and is in contact with a range of NGOs, and business, civic society and political representatives. Its activities include the organisation of and support for visits by politicians and political events, as well as providing regular updates on political topics and developments to the Executive Board. Porsches political activities are coordinated with those of the Volkswagen Group to ensure a joined-up approach and consistent communications in dialogue with partners. Porsche also sits on the Volkswagen Group Public Affairs steering committee, which reports regularly to the Group Board of Management. Principles such as integrity, openness and verifiability, as well as guidelines on contact with politicians are set out in the Group-wide policy. The policy also regulates the political lobbying process. Accordingly, just like all of the brands, foreign markets and divisions that undertake political lobbying in the Volkswagen Group, the people responsible for politics at Porsche provide information to Group Public Affairs about their activities. Activities encompassing business and political organisations also respect the principles of openness, verifiability and responsibility, and are carried out in compliance with competition law, anti-trust and all other legislation. Porsche does not have representative offices in Berlin, Brussels or elsewhere in the world. The list below provides a selection of the companys memberships of business and political organisations and associations:  German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA)  Industry Association of Baden-Wurttemberg (LVI)  Sudwestmetall (Baden-Wurttemberg employers association for the metal and electrical industry)  Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Stuttgart Region (IHK)  Leipzig Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK)  Society for the Advancement of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy  American Chamber of Commerce in Germany e. V. (AmCham Germany) Porsches activities are directed at promoting a Europe that is harmonious, sustainable and internationally competitive. The single European market, cross-border trade, worker freedoms and the sharing of knowledge are fundamental conditions for competitiveness. Porsche supports the objectives of the Paris Agreement and welcomes the European Green Deal as a key framework for the future. The company supports free, fair, sustainable and rules-based international trading relationships that protect human rights and promote prosperity, employment and growth. As a matter of course, Porsche remains impartial in its dealings with political parties and interest groups. The company does not donate to political parties. During the reporting year, it incurred no expenditure related to supporting party events, advertising in publications affiliated with parties, or external lobbying agencies or services. Memberships and networks Cooperating in networks and engaging in sustainability initiatives and working groups also forms part of Porsches stakeholder dialogue as it works to drive forward economic, ecological and social issues. Porsche participates across a broad spectrum of areas. For example, the sports car manufacturer is a founder member of the Bundnis fur Luftreinhaltung clean air alliance, a member of the Plattform Urbane Mobilitat and an active participant in the industry dialogue on the German National Action Plan for Business and Human Rights. It has also been a member of the German Environmental Management Association (B.A.U.M.) since 2016. In 2017, the company joined the German Business Ethics Network (DNWE) and became a signatory to the state of Baden-Wurttembergs WIN! charter for sustainable business, marking its commitment to entrepreneurial responsibility. Since 2018, Porsche has also been one of the cooperation partners involved in the nachhaltig.digital competence platform. The aim of the joint project on the part of B.A.U.M. and the German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU) is to use digitalisation as a tool for future-proof, sustainable development. Together with the Volkswagen Group, Porsche was the first automobile manufacturer to become a core member of the Value Balancing Alliance, doing so at the end of 2019. During the reporting year, the company also joined the Responsible Mica Initiative (RMI). This cross-industry coalition campaigns for transparency and improved working conditions in mica mining. Stakeholder survey and materiality GRI 102-40, 102-43, 102-44, 102-46, 102-47, 102-48 Since 2013, Porsche has asked its stakeholders about their views and expectations on sustainability and future challenges every other year. In autumn 2019, various stakeholders were invited to evaluate the companys sustainability activities for the third time as part of an anonymous and international online survey. In total, 1,459 people from Europe and China responded. Around 79 per cent of the responses came from European markets and around 21 per cent from China. Alongside customers, business partners, analysts/investors, politicians and representatives of public authorities, media outlets, and representatives from NGOs and academia, this survey was the first to feature Porsche employees on a wider scale. Owing to the large number of employee responses, the internal and external stakeholders were assessed using a 50:50 weighting. The responses from external stakeholder groups were also weighted equally. In consultation with internal and external experts, relevant sustainability aspects within the three reporting areas of Innovative Mobility, Reliable Partner and Go to Zero were identified prior to the online survey, and 18 key topics were put to a vote. As well as completing a topic evaluation, the Porsche stakeholders demonstrated in their answers to the additional questions that they perceived climate and environmental impacts, changing mobility needs and the scarcity of energy and resources to be the greatest challenges facing the company both now and in the near future. These views are also reflected in the degree of relevance attributed to the topic by the stakeholders and in the strategic action areas of the Porsche Strategy 2030. The surveyed stakeholders also confirmed the view that there is no conflict in principle between sustainability and the manufacture of premium sports cars, with 81 per cent not believing there to be any incompatibility. The members of Porsches Sustainability Advisory Committee also had the chance to provide detailed feedback on current sustainability topics at Porsche, considering the potential opportunities and risks. They presented specific recommendations for action to further shape Porsches engagement. Areas of importance for the committee included new mobility options, alternative drive systems and vehicle emissions, and stakeholder dialogue. The members of the Sustainability Council discussed their ideas on these issues at two joint meetings with the Porsche Executive Board during the reporting year. A workshop with representatives of the relevant departments at Porsche was held during the autumn of 2019 to assess the companys own impact in detail. In a process covering multiple steps, the workshop evaluated the impact of Porsches business activities on the environment, employees and society in terms of the 18 defined topics. The importance of this topic to the business activity of a sports car manufacturer was also assessed. Porsche pooled the results in a materiality matrix before the start of the reporting year, identifying the most important issues and illustrating how these were linked. The resulting findings will be used for the ongoing development of the companys sustainability strategy. In this report, Porsche refers to all topics resulting from the company values, the Strategy 2030, the risks and opportunities for the company, and its corporate goals. The materiality matrix links the results of the stakeholder survey with the views of the Sustainability Expert Group expressed during the workshop. It establishes a correlation between the direct impact that the business activities have on the environment, employees and society (x-axis) and their relevance for stakeholders (y-axis). As a third dimension to this analysis, Porsche rated the relevance of the 18 key topics to the companys business and illustrated the results of the assessment in differently sized, circular ideograms. The degree of business relevance of the individual topics is shown by means of four levels: none, low, medium and high. The next Porsche stakeholder survey is scheduled for 2021 and will be expanded to cover additional markets. Materiality matrix GRI 102-44, 102-46, 102-47 The resulting findings will be used for the ongoing development of the companys sustainability strategy. In this report, Porsche refers to all topics resulting from the company values, the Strategy 2030, the risks and opportunities for the company, and its corporate goals.

Drive strategy based on three pillars The Porsche drive strategy is based on a triumvirate: emotive combustion, powerful hybrids and high-performance e-mobility. The company will market cars with optimised petrol engines and powerful hybrid drives, as well as all-electric sports cars in parallel. For example, the plug-in hybrids of the Panamera and Cayenne ranges will be developed for performance, with an improved electric range of more than 80 km. The iconic 911 sports car also offers prospects for sporting hybridisation, as already experienced in motorsports. ~15 bn. INVESTMENT IN ELECTRIFICATION, DIGITALISATION AND SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION OF VEHICLES UNTIL 2025 Until 2025, Porsche will invest some 15 billion euros in the electrification, digitalisation and sustainable production of vehicles, consistently expanding its electro mobility offer. The aim is for 50 per cent of all new Porsche vehicles to be electric by 2025. During the reporting year, Porsche celebrated the successful introduction of the all-electric Taycan. An internationally renowned jury voted it the worlds most innovative car in 2020. Despite the fact that Porsche Centres were forced to shut their doors for several weeks, 20,015 units of the new Taycan were delivered in the reporting year. The technological backbone of the Taycan is its 800-volt architecture, which gives the car its sporting driving performance and fast charging times. In addition, the car can deliver its power again and again as required. Charging capacity is up to 270 kW. This means that within five minutes the vehicle can be recharged with enough power to drive up to 100 km (WLTP). The Taycans maximum recuperation power is up to 265 kW and the Taycan 4S has a top range of 464 km (WLTP). And production of the electric sports car at the main plant in Zuffenhausen (Stuttgart) is CO2-neutral. The next model to cross the starting line will be the first derivative of the Taycan, the Cross Turismo. The next generation of the Macan compact SUV will also feature an electric drivetrain, making it Porsches second all-electric range. CO2-neutral PRODUCTION OF THE TAYCAN To make the breakthrough, e-mobility needs an accessible, available charging infrastructure that meets demand and provides a customer-friendly charging process. Porsche is pursuing a holistic approach and is continuing to work on refining charging technologies and developing the charging infrastructure. The aim is to offer new products and services to turn charging into a personal customer experience that is fast and attractive. Through the joint venture IONITY, a network of 350 kW fast charging pedestals is being expanded throughout Europe. The plan is to have 400 charging stations up and running. At home, Porsche customers can top up the Taycans batteries overnight using a Porsche-developed wall box providing up to 22 kW. And on the road, the Porsche Charging Service provides users with access to more than 100,000 charging points across Europe with the possibility of central billing. Alternative fuels In addition to the prioritised electrification strategy, Porsche is also exploring ways of reducing CO2 emissions to make petrolengine and hybrid cars more climate friendly in certain areas, with efficiency measures that allow the use phase to be almost completely CO2 neutral. Here, Porsche is focusing on e-fuels. These are synthetic, liquid fuels that are produced exclusively from hydrogen obtained using renewable power sources and carbon dioxide extracted from the air. The e-fuels could also be used to reduce the CO2 footprint of existing Porsche models, which are renowned for their long useful lives. Together with partners in science and industry, the company is working to develop industrial production of these alternative fuels. Porsche is seeking the best locations around the world to exploit renewable energy sources and guarantee that these new fuels will be competitive. For example, in Baden-Wurttemberg the sports car manufacturer has helped get the e-fuels  rethinking fuel project off the ground as part of the Automotive Industry Strategy Dialogue in Baden-Wurttemberg initiated by the state government. In collaboration with Siemens Energy and a number of international businesses, Porsche developed a pilot project in Chile during the reporting year. The aim of the project is to develop the worlds first integrated, commercial large-scale plant to manufacture synthetic, climate-neutral fuels. The plant is being constructed according to the principles of environmental and social compatibility. The pilot phase will involve the production of some 130,000 litres of e-fuels by 2022. In the second phase, capacity will be increased to around 55 million litres by 2024 and 550 million litres per year in 2026. Porsche is the main buyer of the green fuel manufactured by the pilot plant using electric power generated by the wind. The conditions for wind generation at the project site in Chile are excellent and among the best in the world, with extraordinarily consistent and powerful winds. Diesel As of February 2018 Porsche no longer includes any diesel models in its portfolio. Together with other parts of the Group, the company is also actively committed to bringing down nitrogen oxide levels in German cities. Before Porsches decision to stop selling diesel-powered vehicles, the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) had ordered a recall measure to update the software in certain vehicle types owing to irregularities in the engine management software. The relevant recall for all affected Porsche diesel cars was launched.. In 2017, Porsche Cayenne 3.0-litre V6 diesel cars in the Euro 6 emissions class were recalled in Germany due to individual technical characteristics of the engine management software. In mid-October 2017, the KBA approved the software update proposed by Porsche. Porsche has since recalled the vehicles concerned for a free software update. More than 99 per cent of the affected vehicles in Germany have now been updated. In July 2018, the KBA ordered cars of the type Macan 3.0-litre V6 diesel (Euro 6) to undergo a similar update. The proposed Porsche software update received official approval on 1 August 2018. These vehicles have been accepted back into workshops for a free software update since October 2018. Currently around 98 per cent of the vehicles registered in Germany have been updated. In addition, the KBA issued Porsche with recall notices for the Cayenne 4.2-litre V8 diesel (Euro 5 and Euro 6) and Panamera 4.0-litre V8 diesel (Euro 6). Porsches proposed software update for the Panamera 4.0-litre V8 diesel (Euro 6) was approved by the KBA in August 2019. The recall campaign started in November 2019 and the software update has already been applied to around 93 per cent of the affected vehicles. Approval was granted by the KBA for software updates in respect of the Cayenne 4.2-litre V8 diesel (Euro 5 and Euro 6) in January 2020 (Euro 5) and July 2020 (Euro 6). The owners of the vehicles have been contacted by the responsible Porsche partners and the recall campaign has been launched. So far some 66 per cent of the Cayenne 4.2-litre V8 diesel (Euro 5) models in Germany and 58 per cent of the Cayenne 4.2-litre V8 diesel (Euro 6) models have been updated. In addition, Porsche voluntarily announced in the scope of the National Diesel Forum that it would produce voluntary software updates for Euro 5 3.0-litre V6 diesel Cayenne and Panamera models (184 kW and 221 kW). The KBA approved this voluntary software update in January 2020. The voluntary service campaign was published immediately in the market and made available to customers as a free software update. URBAN MOBILITY MADE MORE CONVENIENT AND MORE FLEXIBLE NEW MOBILITY SERVICES Rising global prosperity and the ensuing increase in demand for mobility have focused even greater attention on the environmental impact of personal transport. Climate change and the shortage of certain resources are creating impetus for innovation and a market for adapting the car and the way in which it is used. Both the diversification of drive concepts to develop more efficient and alternative options, as well as innovative flexible models for car use are the result. Digitalisation and connectivity, as well as customers desire for more flexibility and sustainability, are accelerating this change. Parkinglocation finder PIONEERING SOLUTIONS MAKE PARKING SIMPLER Personal mobility in the smart cityy Mobility today means so much more than simply moving from A to B. Customers expectations for mobility services range from the provision of new hardware concepts to digital services that enable movement. Owning your own car in an urban environment is becoming increasingly challenging. Porsche is therefore working on services that make urban mobility more flexible and more convenient. In cities, mobility is gaining importance as one of the most relevant areas in which quality of life can be improved, and city planners are becoming key stakeholders for the automotive industry. Measures that help to mitigate existing challenges such as congestion, CO2 and noise emissions, wasted time and lack of parking are moving up the priority list. City councils and providers of new mobility solutions need to work in close collaboration to shape urban mobility. Porsche is developing innovative products and services for flexible mobility that meet peoples needs with the aim of creating sustainable personal mobility solutions and making smart cities a reality. These include demand-oriented car usage options (for example flexible usage models and premium rental) and the seamless integration of cars with other forms of transport. Other pioneering solutions are intended to simplify parking (such as an intelligent system to locate parking spaces, and easy-to-use paperless car park ticketing). These reduce the traffic caused by drivers looking for parking spaces and ensure that the available parking facilities are used more efficiently. The vehicle fleet dedicated to flexible usage models is being consistently expanded with new electric cars. Access to new technologies is allowing Porsche to support the process of transformation towards sustainable mobility. This also includes studies into airborne mobility. An international team is working on a range of aspects of urban air mobility. Targeted collaboration The Mobility Services department works as part of the Porsche AG digital product organisation in close cooperation with Porsche Digital GmbH, Porsche Financial Services, Porsche Consulting, external cooperation partners and many other interfaces within the company on concepts for and the operation of new mobility solutions, to keep pace with changing requirements. Agile, interdisciplinary teams develop concepts that are focused primarily on new customer requirements and implement these on their own account. This development is underpinned by tight integration between the companys different departments and an open information policy, as well as by early piloting in various markets and stakeholder involvement. Synergies within the Group are exploited consistently in the development and operation of services. PorscheImpact PORSCHE CUSTOMERS CAN OFFSET THEIR PERSONAL CO2 EMISSIONS Porsche uses a number of tools for fine adjustment in order to continue optimising existing and new mobility services. These include offsetting local CO2 emissions of the Porsche Drive fleet through the Porsche Impact offsetting service www.porsche. com/germany/aboutporsche/responsibility/ porscheimpact and promoting increased take-up of digital processes to further reduce the ecological footprint. Managing mobility at Porsche sites Another priority is the expansion of a sustainable range of mobility options at Porsche sites in the context of site mobility management. The objective is to lessen the environmental and social impact of the workforces use of mobility solutions on the way to and from work and when travelling for business. Since 2015, measures have been implemented specifically to take account of mobility offers at the Porsche sites. For example, employees received a monthly subsidy for a local-transport season ticket targeting commuters as well as for the Deutsche Bahn Job-Ticket. Moreover, travellers on the S-Bahn light rail link between the companys Weilimdorf and Zuffenhausen sites in Stuttgart can present their Porsche works ID card in lieu of a travel ticket when on company business. Frequent shuttle buses run back and forth between the sites for all other work trips in order to reduce the amount of individual traffic. In addition, since 2019 Porsche has operated a cycling scheme for employees, offering attractive subsidised purchase options. The company has also developed its own car-sharing app to promote multiple occupancy of vehicles travelling to and from work and on business trips. The aim is to add flexibility to transport offers. Finding a car parking space at the companys sites has also been improved with the installation of a fixed digital parking guidance and information system. The impact of the measures on the targets that have been set is assessed through employee surveys and traffic flow analyses. The company is witnessing a continual improvement in the modal split  the distribution of traffic across a range of transport options  as well as in the total volume of traffic. NEW CAMPUS AND EMPLOYEE MOBILITY INITIATIVE LAUNCHED Further development of mobility services Thanks to the positive response to measures in the reporting year, the sustainable mobility offer has been further strengthened at Porsche sites and the Campus and Employee Mobility initiative has been launched. All activities for staff mobility are coordinated centrally and a plan of measures proposes step-by-step development of mobility options. Alongside additional schemes to reduce traffic, there are also plans to implement electric micro-mobility pilots such as the offer of e-scooters and e-bikes at Zuffenhausen and the introduction of a company-wide mobility dashboard (for visualising the mobility offer in real time). As part of the expansion of sustainability and alternative forms of mobility, Porsche is also promoting the electrification of its motorised site traffic. An internal network of charging points is being extended, powered by certified green electricity, while new electric vehicles are being added to the fleet of company and leased vehicles all the time. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212 213.

EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND DIVERSITY Porsche is actively committed to diversity and inclusion at the workplace and creates an environment that promotes everyones individuality in the interests of the company. The company firmly believes that diversity of views drives innovation and is thus a key factor in success. Active diversity management creates new ideas, a better understanding of the market and a more attractive employer. 28% SHARE OF WOMEN IN APPRENTICESHIP Diversity as a corporate principle Safeguarding and promoting diversity and equal opportunities are hugely important to Porsche, and are enshrined as a corporate principle in all that it does. The company takes it as a given that all people should be given the same chances, and it rejects all forms of discrimination. The aim is to ensure that all employees can fulfil their individual potential. Respectful, tolerant interaction and a positive approach to a wide range of views  such as different skills, experiences and viewpoints  contribute to the achievement of maximum productivity, competitiveness, innovative capacity, creativity and efficiency. By adding their signature to the Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity Charter) in 2019, the Executive Board and Works Council set out in writing their commitment to diversity as part of Porsche culture. The Equal Opportunities department is responsible for the long-term implementation and securing of equality and diversity at Porsche. It serves as a catalyst and expert partner in the area of HR development and talent strategy. Porsche has set itself the goal of further consolidating diversity of views in the company by 2030 by means of an ambitious, measurable increase in the number of mixed teams throughout the organisation. The basis for this is the strengthening of a mindset among all employees that is conducive to diversity. This involves creating an awareness of the positive effects of and challenges posed by diversity. At the same time, this approach promotes a corporate culture that perceives the diversity of all employees as an advantage and competitive factor for the company  regardless of gender, nationality, ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, sexual orientation or identity. 99NATIONALITIESWORK AT PORSCHE In the event of breach of the principles of equal opportunities and equal treatment, Porsche has an impartial whistleblower system in place, via which any incidents can be investigated and appropriate measures taken. Targeted promotion of diversity As a matter of principle, Porsche selects, hires and promotes its employees according to their qualifications and skills. In keeping with the gender quota required by law, the sports car manufacturer has set itself the target of increasing the proportion of women at the first and second management levels below the Executive Board to 15 per cent by the end of 2021. To achieve this, increasing the proportion of women at all management levels as well as in the pool of young employees has been made a binding target for all managers. In order to be able to measure gender diversity at Porsche, the company participated in the Frauen-Karriere-Index, a management tool for the advancement of women in business, for the first time in 2019 and was duly named Newcomer of the Year. Managers have a key role to play in raising awareness of the importance and added value of equal opportunities and diversity in management and the workforce more generally. As part of the Group initiative Together for Integrity, the opportunities and challenges of equal opportunities and diversity were presented to managers in order to raise their awareness of the issues at stake. A digital Diversity Toolbox is available to them in their day-to-day work and management roles, and provides an overview of the relevant indicators. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, training and events were moved online in 2020. In the online formats, managers and employees have the opportunity to experience diversity of perspective in all its dimensions and to question traditional patterns of thinking and behaviour. In future, the diversity climate factor is to be surveyed as a key strategy indicator to enable the effectiveness of culture-promoting measures at Porsche to be measured. STAFF DEVELOPMENT Digitalisation is visibly transforming our lives and our work, and Porsche and its employees are no exception. New technologies and different ways of working mean that knowledge dates faster than ever before, with the result that activities and the skills needed to per-form them are permanently changing. Porsche provides its experts and managers with the skills they need to keep pace with the challenges posed by change. Training and education during the Covid-19 pandemic The pillars of HR development include, in particular, training that focuses on future requirements, ongoing skills acquisition, and options and routes for internal development. The coronavirus pandemic resulted in training and education courses being provided through online offers during the reporting year. The qualification portfolio was realigned accordingly, and face-to-face formats were adapted to e-learning. >125,000 PARTICIPATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING Staff development at Porsche is founded on a diverse range of vocational training opportunities. A wide range of training courses in commercial and technical professions, a dual study programme and the Porsche Trainee Programme ensure that young employees are given the best start possible. Another important component is the hiring on the basis of permanent contacts of all apprentices who pass their final examination. Throughout their careers, employees have access to a diverse range of programmes for their systematic professional development on all levels. In response to Covid-19, the Warm Up introduction programme was arranged in hybrid form for the first time, combining in-person sessions with a virtual live broadcast. This meant that all new employees were able to take part. The Fit for the Shop Floor induction programme launched back in 2019 for first-level operational managers was further established in 2020, and the first participants successfully completed the full programme during the reporting year. For second-level managers, the Porsche Professional Programme, in place since 2019, supplements the modular and international management qualifications available. Implementation of the modules was also adapted for this programme to ensure that it could continue while retaining the same aims and level of quality. Digital learning Porsches development programme for employees with management potential continued during the reporting year. All of the modules were converted to an online format, including the innovation workshop and the corporate planning game. HRQ!, a customised qualification programme for employees in the HR department, was launched during the reporting year. The programme is designed to help participants gain awareness of how their own role can change in the course of digitalisation. It also aims to systematically develop and expand the required skillsets. The twelve-month programme includes various modules in virtual and face-to-face formats, as well as a specific project from the HR department. In addition to these programmes, the content of the training courses offered to employees and managers has been expanded, with a clear shift towards a virtual or blended learning model, in other words a combination of in-person components and e-learning. New training courses were developed and launched for managers on topics including Leadership and Digital Transformation, Leading Innovation Teams and Inspiring Communication. What they all have in common is that they achieve sustainable learning outcomes through a modular blended learning approach combined with transfer tasks. In addition, participants can be supported by leadership coaches during their transfer phases. Topics such as mindfulness and effective self-leadership, and conflict management specifically during project work or when working in virtual teams are examples of the new material available to all employees. Virtual or blended learning methods are also used here. Tools such as the Transfer app have also been used to help anchor the course content permanently in practice through stimuli and microtasks. Approx.2,000 ATTENDANCES OF THE DIGITAL DAYS 2020 Due to changes in ways of working as a result of the pandemic, both digital technologies and virtual collaboration gained importance in 2020. The knowledge campaign Fit for Digit@l launched in 2017 provided an excellent basis for this. Through a targeted expansion of the training on offer and the switch from in-person to live online sessions, Porsche made sure that its employees were fit for digitalisation. In addition to communicating current trends, the main focus in the reporting year was on in-depth technical training in Porsches areas of activity as part of the companys digitalisation strategy (Mission D). During the Digital Days 2020, specialist presentations given by digital strategy project managers were offered via Microsoft Teams for a whole week. With over 2,000 people signing up, a larger target group was reached than would have been achieved using a traditional format. A virtual exhibition was also developed in the 3D environment Porsche Spaces, giving employees the opportunity to explore the digital transformation at Porsche virtually. With over 5,000 installations, this exhibition also met with great interest and will continue to be available in 2021. Strategic skills management Against the backdrop of the Porsche Strategy and the far-reaching changes in the automotive industry, the structured creation and expansion of future-oriented skills among all employees is a vital aspect of HR development. The strategic skills management approach was developed in response to this. Based on current and anticipated future roles, skills, job functions and requirements are assessed and matched in qualitative and quantitative terms through a systematic process. Any identified skill gaps can thus be addressed at an early stage, for example through targeted re-training and further training, recruitment and new priorities in ongoing training. Strategic skills management continued to be rolled out across further areas of Porsche AG in 2020. Targeted monitoring of skills acquisition will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of measures and direct the programme in the long term. In 2020, the Skills Group concept involving representatives from specialist departments, the Works Council and HR was piloted in the area of technical development. Qualification and Development Appraisals, a new approach for short to medium-term qualification and further development of employees was designed and tried out in selected areas. The method focuses on regular, structured dialogue between employees and line managers in relation to each individuals training needs and options for development as well as targets. The Porsche Skills Areas, which describe clusters of professional and interdisciplinary skills, have been defined as an instrument to guide the appraisals. These areas are defined and applied taking account of the findings from strategic skills management. CORPORATE CO-DETERMINATION GRI 102-41 One of the key pillars of Porsches corporate culture is corporate co-determination. There is regular dialogue between employer and employees, including on critical issues. Open and direct communication across all hierarchical levels is a long-standing tradition at Porsche. It provides the basis for exceptionally constructive cooperation. Works Councils and collective agreements Porsches main site is in Germany. This means that it is required by law to engage in collective co-determination. The company has been proactive in meeting this obligation for decades, and has positive experience in this area. For Porsche, it is natural for employees and their legal representatives to be informed about any significant changes as soon as possible and in as much detail as possible, whether these changes relate to operational workflows or the organisation of the company. This is done in compliance with national laws, applicable collective bargaining agreements and works agreements, including beyond Germanys borders. The foundations for this work are laid by, for example, the Supervisory Board with equal representation, the Works Council committees, a range of communication formats and the works agreement database on the intranet. Porsche has in place collective agreements on wages and conditions that apply to all fulltime and part-time employees. Transparent remuneration is ensured on the basis of the applicable pay framework agreement. An additional Labour Market of the Future package has been agreed, which brings together numerous working time regulations. These include flexible working hours, voluntary personal sabbaticals and care leave. Porsche AG, as a member company of the employer association Sudwestmetall, is part of the actively promoted social partnership between the metal and electronics industry and the IG Metall trade union. Open communication channels Porsche offers its employees numerous ways of making suggestions, reporting problems or registering complaints with committees and decision-making bodies. One example includes the union ombudsman structure. It is also possible to talk directly to individual members of the Works Council at any time. Alongside the Works Council, there are also interest groups for employees with severe disabilities and representation for young workers and trainees. Both of these bodies are closely integrated with the Works Council and involved in its decision-making processes. Co-determination in the workplace continues to play an important role in the new digital era. The primary aim here is to cover all mandatory areas requiring co-determination by law to ensure compliance. Examples include the introduction of IT systems that are capable of monitoring employee behaviours or performance, or data protection measures and rules on the use of electronic media for communication. Porsches employee representatives are always involved at an early stage in the process design. Close collaboration between the company and employee representatives is also vital when it comes to research into operating solutions for the new digital world of work. Internal media are used to inform employees about current topics, especially from the perspective of the employees and their elected representatives. In addition, the Works Council keeps employees fully updated about its works meetings at each of Porsches sites in Germany and thus provides an open platform for discussion. The coronavirus pandemic during the reporting year meant that no works meetings could take place. Communication with the workforce continued through the intranet, by video and by letter and e-mail, however. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY The protection of employee health is a core responsibility for any company. It is also a basic prerequisite for ensuring a motivated and capable workforce. Porsches occupational health and safety management plays a key role in ensuring that the company can continue to develop, produce and sell exclusive cars in the future. Regulated occupational safety processes Occupational safety is a top priority for Porsche and its employees. An organised and structured system for occupational health and safety ensures a uniform approach and the implementation of legal provisions. This system helps to prevent accidents at work and occupational illnesses as far as possible. The central processes are standardised and regulated by the Group guideline on occupational safety. Since occupational safety is regulated in law in Germany, the Group guideline represents a major element of the Porsche compliance management system. It applies to the whole workforce. The managers ensure that their employees are familiar and comply with the provisions of this guideline. Specialists in occupational safety, Works Council members and works doctors are available to all employees in an advisory capacity. All staff members are also represented through their legally defined representatives in the occupational safety committees in accordance with the Occupational Safety Act. The Group guideline is currently being updated. It will be extended to include provisions on health protection to form the basis for a certifiable occupational safety management system. Safe and humane working conditions are particularly important in respect of the challenge of a more quickly moving and demanding working environment, brought about by automation and the digital revolution. The Occupational Safety department is open to receiving queries from employees. In addition, it regularly tours workplaces with managers who have local responsibilities and provides support for risk assessments and standard operating procedures. Workplaces, machinery and equipment are designed with input from safety engineers with the aim of preventing accidents and risks to health. Construction and installation sites are monitored and supported by special construction experts beyond what is required by law. Safety standards are subject to ongoing refinement as part of this process. On the basis of the Occupational Safety Act, works physicians advise on the design of healthy and ergonomic workplaces. They provide employees with advice and carry out preventive checks. In addition, they support the first aid organisation and help with the reintroduction of employees to the workplace after illness. 6.1 INJURY RATE AT PORSCHE AG In the event of accidents at work, the causes are analysed in detail and measures implemented in the form of action plans to avoid future accidents. The occurrence of accidents in the workplace at Porsche and in its organisational units is measured using the injury rate (occupational accident index) and reported monthly. Annual limits are set with the aim of registering continual improvement in the safety of employees at the workplace. Preventive health management Health management encompasses all of the topics that contribute to the health of employees. In addition to safety systems and provision of local medical care for employees at work at the sites, there are additional services for preventive health promotion activities in the workplace. Porsche Health Management offers courses on healthy eating, relaxation techniques and effective self management. Employees can also access individual physiotherapy advice at the workplace. The Health Management division is responsible for all health promotion activities, structures and processes. Various departments are responsible for providing medical care at work. Occupational medicine plays a key role in the Works Health Management as a preventive discipline. The roles of works doctors include analysis of the effects of work on employees, as well as the promotion of employee health and capabilities and support for the company, the employer, in planning for healthy working conditions. The department also has emergency paramedics who provide acute and emergency healthcare in the factory. Porsche has a specific occupational reintegration management for restoring employees capabilities after longer periods of illness. The affected employees are accompanied through a phased reintroduction to the workplace to assist them as they get back to work. The company also provides social care for those with psychosocial concerns. Employee integration All employees are represented in occupational safety committees by statutory representation. The site-specific occupational safety committees meet four times each year. All employees receive information on occupational safety and health protection topics at least once a year. This ensures that they are kept up to date on specific hazards and rules of conduct. The intranet also contains a broad range of information and education on health and safety at the workplace. To avoid risks to other companies employees at Porsche sites as much as possible, Porsche stipulates detailed rules of conduct. These apply in particular to construction sites, but also to the procurement and assembly of machinery and equipment. Support during the coronavirus pandemic Porsches risk mitigation organisation dealt in detail with the coronavirus pandemic during the reporting year. It agreed all of the measures required to protect employee health. In addition to providing information to affected internal departments, this also included communication with public authorities. A telephone help desk and central mailbox are used by employees as a point of contact for all queries relating to coronavirus. Employees engaged in administration activities were able to work remotely for their own protection. In 2019, the conduct principles were updated in accordance with the Group guidelines on compliance management. These guidelines set out all aspects of employees responsibility for compliance: COMPLIANCE AND INTEGRITY Compliance with applicable laws and acting with integrity are essential to responsible operations. Porsche promotes integrity as a key personal attitude for employees and compliance is framed as conforming to rules. Established compliance structure The point of compliance is to avoid penalties, fines, claims for damages or other legal consequences for the company or its employees. In addition, compliance contributes to protecting the companys good reputation and therefore helps to avoid loss of trust, including among customers and partners. The company has put in place a compliance structure based around its business model to ensure that it acts lawfully, with legally secure processes and preventive and reactive measures. Porsches compliance management system currently encompasses six areas of compliance, including anti-corruption and anti-money laundering measures. In order to avoid any infringements of the law and to help its employees act in accordance with legal and statutory provisions, Porsche has had a compliance system in place for many years now. This system includes a chief compliance officer, and compliance officers at Porsche AG and at the Group member companies covering every area of the business. The compliance programme encompasses a range of different preventive and reactive measures, while regular risk analysis is carried out to define areas that require action and preventive measures. The companys business model, relevant environmental conditions and the relationships with business partners are all taken into account. Key preventive measures at Porsche include the adoption and communication of binding rules, and the provision of confidential advice. Ultimately, the code of conduct sets out the most important rules to be applied at Porsche in accordance with the companys business model. This code documents the expectations of managers and staff in terms of the responsibility they must assume for compliance as a member of society, as a business partner and at the workplace. The rules are also set out in guidelines, covering such areas as how to avoid corruption or violations of antitrust law, how to handle conflicts of interest or the receipt of gifts, and how to prevent money laundering. To ensure and promote lawful behaviour over the long term, all managers and employees are given regular targeted information and training on compliance and the related risks. Porsches central compliance help desk provides information and advice on compliance issues internally, providing expert answers to all questions from managers and employees alike. In addition, information about potential violations of rules and laws can be passed to the internal whistleblower function acting as the interface to the whistleblowing system. Outside the company, Porsche managers, employees, customers and business partners, as well as public officials and other external individuals, can report legal violations anonymously via two ombudsmen. All reports are investigated with care and with due consideration of the applicable data protection rules, and any violations found are responded to appropriately in accordance with the relevant provisions of the employment and co-determination laws. This includes introducing suitable countermeasures and sanctioning cases of individual misconduct. The Executive Board of Porsche AG receives regular reports on actions taken by the compliance organisation and on preventive and response measures implemented in the Porsche Group. A key emphasis of compliance communication in 2020 was the publication of updated contact details for the whistleblower system. In addition, a guide to submission of relevant information on possible compliance breaches was published. An intranet article, explainer video and an FAQ allowed employees to find out all they need to know. The effectiveness of the compliance management system is audited by the specialist department as part of the GRC process and in rotation by the Internal Audit department. Code of conduct for employees The code of conduct for employees was updated in 2020, in accordance with the terms of the Group guidelines on compliance management and the whistleblower system. These guidelines set out all aspects of employees responsibility for compliance:  as members of society: human rights; equal opportunity and equal treatment; product conformity and product safety; environmental protection; donations, sponsorships and charity; communications and marketing; political lobbying.  as business partners: conflicts of interest; gifts, hospitality and invitations; prohibition of corruption; dealings with public officials and holders of political office; prohibition of money laundering and terrorism financing; accounting and financial reporting; taxes and customs; fair and free competition; procurement; export control; prohibition of insider trading  at the workplace: occupational safety and healthcare; data protection; security and protection of information, know-how and intellectual property; IT security; handling company assets. Approx.6,000 EMPLOYEES RECEIVED ANTI-CORRUPTION TRAINING IN 2020 In addition, the code of conduct for business partners has been updated in line with the Group guideline on the whistleblower system and published on the internet. The guideline governs Porsches expectations of its business partners for compliance with applicable laws. Acknowledgement of principles of ethical conduct and expectations for acting sustainably are also enshrined in this binding document.

Protection of human rights Porsche is well aware of its challenges in the supply chain and rejects child labour, forced labour and compulsory labour as well as all forms of modern slavery and human trafficking. A transparent certificate of origin and contractually binding sustainability requirements are important steps in ensuring fair competition and preventing exploitation linked to raw materials. Along with the Volkswagen Group, the company is actively engaged in industry dialogue on the German federal government's National Action Plan for Business and Human Right. The aim of this dialogue is to guarantee human working conditions from one end of the supply chain to the other. Via the Volkswagen Group, Porsche is also a member of the World Economic Forums Global Battery Alliance. Featuring public and private partners along the entire battery supply chain, the Global Battery Alliance strives to ensure social and ecological sustainability throughout the whole value chain of the raw materials used in batteries. In October 2020 Porsche joined the Responsible Mica Initiative. This cross-industry association of international companies and non-governmental organisations is committed to transparency and improved working conditions in relation to the mining of mica. Mica is used as a raw material in many industrial and cosmetic products. As an automobile manufacturer that uses mica in its paints, Porsche also contributes to the worldwide consumption of this raw material. Porsche represents the Volkswagen Group in the Responsible Mica Initiative. CONSISTENT USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IN PRODUCTION OF HV BATTERY CELLS CO2 emissions and sustainable materials in the supply chain Based on a hotspot analysis, Porsche held numerous workshops with suppliers from relevant industries in the reporting year to coordinate and pursue targets and measures to reduce CO2 emissions and encourage use of sustainable materials. The biggest driver of CO2 emissions in the supply chain for electric vehicles is the HV battery cells. For this reason, Porsche has consistently made the use of renewable energies for the production of HV battery cells a contractual requirement. Additionally, the company was involved in the development of a blockchain pilot application together with its suppliers BASF and Motherson, with the aim of making greenhouse gas emissions in supply chains traceable. On the basis of smart contracts, which are made available to the companies involved in the process, the CO2 emissions generated by individual components are passed on digitally along the entire supply chain. This means that the CO2 footprint of a product can be quantified in a standardised way. Porsche is also doing more to raise awareness of sustainability in the supply chain among its employees and suppliers, staging events dedicated to this issue. These included a virtual Supplier TechDay during the reporting year. The aim of the event, focusing on sustainable materials, was to identify potential for the use of more environmentally friendly materials in future models and to inform suppliers about Porsches sustainability goals. More than 20 companies in total presented their technologies in the focus areas of aluminium components, recycled or renewable raw materials, and sustainable interior concepts, the most promising of which are being followed up internally. measures, with support from the Environ-The long service life of Porsche sports cars, The concept of the circular economy is GO TO ZERO SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS Sustainability in product development ment and Energy Management department.

This supports the Group companies systematic implementation of the required sumption and waste volumes are evaluated. Use of renewables Energy consumption at Porsche has risen in recent years. This can be attributed to expanded production, comprehensive construction activities and a growing workforce. At the same time, the specific CO2 output per vehicle produced has been reduced by switching to renewable energy sources and biogas. 26.5 % ENERGY CONSUMPTION PER VEHICLE PRODUCED SINCE 2014 Since 2017, the electricity used by Porsche in Zuffenhausen has been generated exclusively from renewable sources. With the opening of the new Taycan factory, certified biogas has been added to the energy mix for generation of power and heating. The highly efficient CHP plant located adjacent to production and office buildings provides heating and a portion of the electrical energy required and complements the sites ecofriendly energy supply. These systems have achieved overall efficiency of more than 83 per cent. The new, energy-efficient buildings in Zuffenhausen clearly exceed the statutory requirements. They use on average 15 per cent less energy than the previous construction standard. Environmental compliance Environmental protection is one of the six compliance topics at Porsche. It represents the objective of adhering to all regulations pertaining to environmental and energy legislation. These include European regulations and directives, federal and state requirements within Germany, as well as local bylaws. Officers appointed within the Environment and Energy Management department follow all of the relevant legal developments, evaluating their impact on the company and informing the affected areas. During the reporting period, there were no known breaches of environmental legislation at the Porsche sites. Complaints management The Porsche Environment and Energy Management team are the point of contact for queries, suggestions and concerns about environmental issues expressed by both internal and external stakeholders. The companys aim is to maintain an open and transparent channel for stakeholder dialogue. An example for this is the central complaints management function in the Politics and Society and Environment and Construction Management departments. Porsches neighbours may contact central contact persons with any complaints or suggested improvements. This system enables the company to respond quickly when required and to incorporate suggestions into its long-term planning for the improvement of its sites. RESOURCE CONSUMPTION DURING PRODUCTION Humans are consuming a significantly larger proportion of resources than the Earth can sustain. Industrial companies also bear a large amount of the responsibility for more sustainable manufacturing and reducing the consumption of raw materials. Porsche pursues the vision of a Zero Impact Factory with production that has no negative impact on the environment. Objective: environmentally neutral production Porsches aim for production that does not impact the environment is built on various action areas. These include efficient use of resources and materials, as well as topics such as pollutants and climate protection. The Zero Impact Factory is based on a total of twelve action areas, including resource, material and energy efficiency, and efficient water usage. Other topics such as technology and processes, and logistics, also affect the companys use of resources. A bespoke strategy allows systematic approaches to ensure the targets the company has set for itself are reached. Key aspects include the targeted reductions in the five core areas of energy, CO2, waste, water and VOC per vehicle, which should be cut by 45 per cent in the period from 2014 to 2025. Using water as efficiently as possible, through circulation systems and multiple reuse, and the careful handling of contaminated production waste water are important aspects in this regard. Avoiding waste, harnessing low-waste technologies and deploying sustainable disposal solutions are key elements of Porsches waste management concept. The companys environmental protection resource regulation serves as an internal guideline and is also binding on suppliers. The strategy forms part of Porsches environment management, which has been certified across the company in accordance with the environmental management standards ISO 14001 and EMAS (at the Zuffenhausen site). Employee participation in these efforts is essential. Awareness of the relevant issues is raised by means of various measures, including an e-learning module, and employees pursue firmly anchored goals. More than 300 individual measures have been implemented since 2015. Responsible use of natural resources has a positive effect on the environment in addition to reducing costs. Therefore, Porsche is investing in switching its traditional lighting systems to energy-saving LED lights, in demand-driven ventilation systems in the bodyshop, in recycling heat produced by the paintshop and in electromechanical production technologies rather than hydraulic work processes. This final example achieves an annual saving of more than 100,000 kWh just in the riveting process at the bodyshop in Zuffenhausen. 4kg WASTE VOLUME FOR DISPOSAL PER VEHICLE PRODUCED Waste management Porsches waste management system is based on a closed-loop system. Its aim is to avoid waste and return materials to the loop in order to protect natural resources. All waste at Porsche is separated for collection on the basis of the ISO 14001 certified environmental management system. Wherever waste is produced, labelled bins or containers are provided for each type of waste. In addition to avoiding waste, Porsche also pursues the aim of increasing the amount of material contained within waste that it can reuse or repurpose. This includes material and thermal recycling processes to reuse materials and the energy that they store. Water and effluents Climate change is resulting in increasing periods of drought, even in Germany. Proactive, responsible management of water is therefore an essential instrument in the effort to make careful use of this resource. Porsche is continuously reducing its water consumption and production of effluents, thereby lessening the environmental impact in terms of drinking water and groundwater shortages. Since 2014, the company has already reduced its fresh-water consumption per vehicle produced by more than 13 per cent. 13.1% FRESH WATER CONSUMPTION PER VEHICLE PRODUCED SINCE 2014 Porsches process facilities such as vehicle leak testing equipment, washing equipment and parts washing equipment operate largely in a closed-loop system. In both paint shops, cascade rinsing is used to recycle water, and bath treatment helps to extend life in pretreatment and in dip coating. The cooling systems at Zuffenhausen are mostly closed loops. Porsche has installed water-saving fittings in its bathrooms. Since 2010, the Zuffenhausen site has only used water from the communal water supply. Treatment of the plant water source to provide its own drinking water supply was not economically viable and was stopped. All Porsche sites are located away from water stressed areas. All water pollutants produced at Porsche are transported, filled into containers, stored or reused on site, in all hazard classes. The company has effectively reduced the risk of production interruptions when handling water-polluting substances by raising awareness among employees, fitting technical protective devices to the production systems and by installing binding-agent stations at outdoor locations. The waste water that is generated from production is pretreated in the companys own water treatment plant in order to remove or reduce pollutants. Waste water from the paint shops and washing lines, washing stations and vehicle leak test systems is pretreated using waste water treatment equipment that has been approved or notified in accordance with water legislation. The effluents are regularly analysed and monitored in accordance with the requirements of the authorities. Green logistics strategy Throughout the entire value chain, the companys logistics operations exploit potential to reduce CO2 in order to contribute actively to the aims of the Paris Climate Agreement. Porsche therefore has adopted sustainability as a number-one priority area for logistics. A range of measures and potential options have been identified and implemented as part of the Green Logistics strategy to efficiently reduce emissions and the impact on the environment. During the reporting year, Porsches logistics transportation used six natural gas HGVs, one hybrid HGV and one all-electric HGV. The range of LNG HGVs is 600 to 800 kilometres, so they can therefore be used for long-range trips. The local infrastructure for these is excellent, with three LNG stations located close to the Zuffenhausen plant. 3,500 LESS TRIPS 10% CO2 SAVINGS Eurotrailers are used at the Zuffenhausen site, thus saving more than 3,500 trips each year, or around ten per cent of CO2. The trips saved by the use of these vehicles would create a traffic jam of around 58 kilometres if the lorries were parked end to end. Porsche uses long trailers for inbound logistics (deliveries of materials) and outbound logistics (delivery of finished vehicles). A long trailer can hold eight vehicles rather than the usual average of six or seven, irrespective of how they are loaded. This allows an annual saving of up to 2,000 HGV trips, corresponding to 19 tons of CO2. Since 2018, all rail transportation of finished vehicles from the loading stations at Kornwestheim and Leipzig to the ports of Emden and Bremerhaven has used renewable power. This means that these journeys are completely climate-neutral. The Volkswagen Group is one of the first automobile manufacturers in the world to use low-emissions LNG vessels to ship finished vehicles, on its route from Emden to North America. This achieves substantial reductions in emissions compared with traditional methods: up to 25 per cent of CO2, 30 per cent of nitrogen oxides, up to 60 per cent of particulates and as much as 100 per cent of sulphur oxides. The Group currently operates two ships transporting a mixture of models. These can carry up to 4,800 vehicles. CONSERVATION AND BIODIVERSITY As part of the ecosystem, biodiversity is vital for human life. Protecting diversity of species is therefore far more than simply nature conservation; alongside climate change it is one of the biggest global challenges of our time. Porsche recognises this situation and is actively committed to preserving biodiversity at its sites. Evaluating and managing biodiversity Porsches conservation efforts are focused on its sites and their immediate environment. The companys objective is to protect the occupied and unoccupied natural landscape and to minimise its own environmental footprint. Porsche pays particular attention to maintaining biological diversity, allowing nature to operate and find its own balance, and securing the future capacity of nature and the landscape to recover. In order to better evaluate and manage the diversity of species at its production sites, the sports car manufacturer uses an innovative biodiversity tool developed by Volkswagen Group researchers. Starting in 2021, Porsche will be one of the first brands in the Volkswagen Group to study its Zuffenhausen site according to defined biodiversity criteria. The investigation will evaluate four areas: surface management, external impact, internal impact and local factors. In the future, the company will increase its use of environmental principles and natural concepts. Its approach will take account of both ecological aspects and the importance for diversity, and the required maintenance effort. For example, highly diverse wild-flower meadows will be cut just one to three times a year, and will require significantly less maintenance than grass lawns. Among the additional benefits of a natural environment within the companys premises are improvements in employee health and well-being thanks to an attractive workplace and higher scores in the scope of building certification by the Germany Sustainable Building Council (DGNB). Sustainable concept for protection of honey bees In the scope of its commitment to nature and species conservation at the Zuffenhausen site, the company introduced 13 bee colonies, each with some 50,000 bees, to a naturally grown fruit orchard located within the perimeter during the reporting year. As a result, a total of 650,000 honey bees made a new home in the natural area situated between a staff car park and the Taycan assembly factory. Germanys bee population is considered to be at risk; more than half of the 560 native types of bee are in danger of dying out. 650,000 HONEY BEES AT STUTTGARTZUFFENHAUSEN SITE The main plant in Zuffenhausen near Stuttgart is the second Porsche site to get its own bee colonies. Since 2017, some three million honey bees have occupied the offroad area of the Leipzig plant, which has been returned to nature. The life of the honey bee also forms part of the Porsche Safari environmental education programme, which is delivered in collaboration with the Auwald Leipzig educational organisation. Between March and October, school classes and children with their families can take a tour of the Porsche Leipzig offroad track and discover everything there is to know about its fauna and flora. Porsches sustainable meadow concept at its Leipzig site is unique within the automotive industry. In addition to honey bees, the sports car manufacturer also introduced Exmoor ponies and wild oxen to the offroad site in 2002. A natural area of 132 hectares is now home to many more wild animals. The company is also committed to protecting biodiversity around the Porsche Development Centre in Weissach. Even bigger conservation measures on site are in the pipeline. Experts in landscape design and conservation collaborated with the company on the development of a guideline that recommends specific actions for future planting and creation of green spaces. Special attention has been paid to the particular requirements of protected species of wild bee. The aim of the renaturisation efforts is to create a wildlife corridor leading to local natural resources and species outside the Development Centre. EMPLOYEES, SOCIETY, SPORTS AND COMMUNICATIONS Employees Society Sports Communications EMPLOYEES High approval ratings in the in-house mood barometer, a staff turnover rate of well below one per cent for years and top rankings in a wide range of employer league tables: Porsche AG continues to be an attractive employer from many perspectives. Thanks to a close working relationship between employers and employees, Porsche has succeeded time and again in positioning itself as a sustainable and reliable employer to its employees, who currently total 36,359 (as of 31 December 2020). This is impressively underlined by the Securing a Plants Future 2020 plans for the companies of Porsche AG. With a realignment in the reporting year, the HR and Social Policy department is also laying the foundation for shaping change even more intensively in the age of digitalisation. A key task here is to work together with the other departments under the theme of Restructuring, not expansion to identify future needs and to qualify the Porsche workforce for the challenges ahead. DESPITE ALL THE CHANGES THERE IS ONE THING WE CAN SURE OF ABOUT THE FUTURE: AT PORSCHE, PEOPLE ARE AT THE CENTRE OF THE COMPANY. Andreas Haffner, Member of the Executive Board  Human Resources Crisis management in response to Covid-19 The Porsche Corporate Security unit manages the sports car manufacturers emergency response organisation (GAO), together with Porsche health management. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the Corporate Security function is currently in continuous operation. As Porsches crisis team, the GAO comprises the GAO managers from the German sites, representatives from Human Resources, the Works Council, Communications, Production, Development and Finance. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the crisis team has been meeting several times a week, and over the past few months has made hundreds of decisions and implemented the related measures. These have included updated travel guidelines, the early recall of staff on overseas assignments, dealing with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 cases, general hygiene and behavioural measures, guidelines for meetings, dealing with suppliers travelling from risk areas, and much more. A hotline and a central mailbox provide employees with a point of contact for questions about coronavirus at any time of day or night. Employees Porsche AG Group 36,359 35,429 32,325 29,777 27,612 25 20 15 10 5 0 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Employees, Society, Sports and Communications Porsche health management takes the strain During the reporting year, Porsches health management was the central point of contact and main advisory body for all issues relating to the coronavirus pandemic. As part of Porsches emergency response organisation, the health management unit was monitoring the development of the pandemic from the beginning of the year, with appropriate measures being developed and implemented in response. The primary goal was and remains to protect the health of the Porsche workforce  through comprehensive communications and specific instructions for action, relating to work in production and administration for example. Covid-19 testing centres have also been set up at the Zuffenhausen and Weissach sites to enable employees with relevant symptoms to access a test quickly and easily. In addition, health management has added an important component to its attractive range of services: since autumn 2020, Porsche AG employees with a cancer diagnosis have been able to obtain an independent second opinion free of charge at the Robert Bosch Centre for Tumour Diseases (RBCT). Where appropriate, genetic analysis will also be carried out. On this basis, cancer patients can be given an individual therapy recommendation in accordance with the latest scientific standards. The RBCT is based at the Robert Bosch Hospital (RBK) in Stuttgart, a world-leading establishment in cancer diagnostics and therapy with its OncoCure programme. Since autumn 2020, Porsche AG employees with a cancer diagnosis have been able to obtain an independent second opinion free of charge at the Robert Bosch Centre for Tumour Diseases (RBCT). Reorganisation of Human Resources and Social Affairs In our increasingly complex world, the demands on human resources work are also growing. For this reason, the Human Resources department at Porsche AG was reorganised in the 2020 financial year to ensure that it is fit for its future role. The main focus was on the changing needs of internal and external customers. Specifically, this relates to employees, managers and job applicants. Greater specialisation in HR consulting will further increase the quality of service and advice provided to employees. Additionally, the HR Business Partners now support managers even more comprehensively with regard to leadership issues, change processes and organisational matters. There is also a special area for executive support, talent development, international mobility and support for the subsidiaries. The recruitment process has been redesigned with the recruitment unit now responsible for all internal and external application processes from start to finish, i.e. from the relevant department first requesting that a position be filled to looking after the successful candidate on their first day. The steering functions and competence centres, for example in the areas of HR Strategy and Innovations, HR and Social Policy or HR Development, have also been given a more precisely defined profile. The reorganisation process additionally involved analysing all HR processes and giving these a new description where necessary. Artificial intelligence in Human Resources The term artificial intelligence (AI) is currently on everyones lips, and AI applications are also increasingly being used in Porsche Human Resources. This is based on the transparent and responsible handling of new technologies, with the aim of enabling a positive customer experience and creating scope for value-adding activities. A good example of this is the Porsche Employee Assistant  a chatbot for employees that is available around the clock to discuss HR issues in particular. This is a valuable tool, especially during the pandemic, for answering frequently asked questions about Covid-19, current business travel regulations or mobile working. There are plans for the chatbot to be further expanded into a digital personal assistant, which would be able to hold conversations, carry out actions and also respond to voice input. With the help of HR predictive analytics, Porsche is also looking into the future, using data patterns to try to identify trends. For example, a pilot project has investigated the future possibility of being able to predict the monthly health status at Porsche. Meanwhile, a digital training assistant could suggest relevant training seminars to employees on the internal Porsche learning platform, similar to personalised product recommendations on online shopping portals in the consumer environment. Porsche Ideas Management (PIDM) To enable even more colleagues to participate in Porsche Ideas Management (PIDM), the PIDM target group has been extended. This means that temporary and contract workers, trainees, interns and student employees, as well as employees of other German Group companies, can now also submit their ideas. With the complete digitalisation and useroriented optimisation of the PIDM workflow, the My Porsche Cockpit provides all of the information needed by those submitting ideas, managers, reviewers and those responsible for implementing the ideas in one place. New remuneration system for (senior) management With effect from 1 January 2020, Porsche made changes to its remuneration system for its (senior) managers. The changes were made in connection with the standardisation of the remuneration system for management throughout the Volkswagen Group and forms part of the group strategy TOGETHER  Strategy 2025. The aim is to offer a level of remuneration that is appropriate and attractive by national and international standards. The remuneration criteria are the individual staff members remit and the companys economic situation, performance and outlook. Porsches new remuneration system is made up of fixed and variable components. 50 per cent of the variable remuneration consists of an annual bonus based on a one-year assessment period. The other 50 per cent is based on a longterm incentive in the form of a three-year performance share plan (based on the last three financial years including the year under review). The annual bonus is generally based on the operating return on sales and operating return on investment recorded by the Porsche Group and/or Porsche brand. The long-term incentive is linked to the (steady state) development of virtual preferred shares of the Volkswagen Group over the last three years. This multi-year assessment basis takes into account both positive and negative devel opments. A digital training assistant gives employees suggestions for relevant training courses on the Porsche internal learning platform. Expansion of Porsche JobRad scheme Twelve subsidiaries now offer the Porsche JobRad scheme to employees. This is an attractive and tax-efficient company bike scheme for staff. Since February 2020, the employees of Porsche Lizenz- und Handelsgesellschaft mbH have also been able to use the scheme, which was originally launched by Porsche back in April 2019. More than 4,500 bikes have been made available during this time, with demand from across all employee groups. Employees who cover more than half of their commute to work each month by company bike were able to apply for an employer subsidy for a Porsche JobRad bike for the first time in the reporting year. The internal mobility survey conducted in February 2020 also showed that cycling is increasingly the preferred form of transport for the commute to work. This figure has actually tripled compared with 2015. In this way, Porsche employees are helping to reduce their carbon footprint simply through their daily commute. Securing a plants future Electrification, digitalisation, decarbonisation  the transformation of the automobile industry is also challenging Porsche. Against this backdrop, it was important for the Executive Board and full Works Council of Porsche AG to agree on the Tradition. Transformation. Tomorrow package of measures in 2020. The measures, which are far-reaching and forward-looking, aim to make sustainable improvements to the companys competitiveness. The agreement covers a ten-year period. Its main priority is to secure the long-term future of the core workforce. The measures agreed to increase flexibility and productivity, as well as to secure the companys results, will be key factors in the future viability of Porsche. Taycan recruitment completed Porsche successfully completed the largest recruitment drive in its history in 2020. Since the start of the recruitment process in November 2018, around 2,000 new employees have been hired for the production of the Taycan in Zuffenhausen. In addition, a further 500 new colleagues have been hired for other direct production areas in the reporting year. Through a large number of applicant days, Human Resources and Production gave interested specialists the opportunity to find out about job opportunities at Porsche during personal discussions. Another important measure for the ramp-up of Taycan production is the Groups cooperation with Audi in Neckarsulm. Under a fixed-term two-year agreement, around 400 Audi employees have been transferred to Porsche since June 2020. Diversity Challenge with Sami Khedira World Cup winner Sami Khedira challenged the Porsche workforce to a Diversity Team Challenge on the occasion of the 8th German Diversity Day. Around 32,000 employees at the German sites were invited to take part in a digital quiz on diversity and inclusion in randomly selected teams of four. The aim was to raise employee awareness of the huge potential of working teams that are as diverse as possible. The aim was also to show that each person, with their individual abilities and perspectives on life, is important for joint success. Sami Khedira led by example with his own team. The 33-year-old has been playing international football for many years and is an ambassador for Porsches youth development programme Turbo for Talents. The footballers background makes him uniquely placed to stand for diversity and equal opportunities. A clear signal on Christopher Street Day In the interests of a colourful society: to tie in with Christopher Street Day (CSD), Porsche has sent a clear signal of acceptance and trust for one another around the theme of Diversity needs support. Every year at the end of July, millions of people around the world stand up for the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, taking a stand against discrimination. Porsche also got involved in 2020 with a range of different activities. Andreas Haffner, Member of the Executive Board for Human Resources, was the sponsor of this initiative. He is also a sponsor of the Proud@Porsche network. As a visible sign of acceptance and inclusion of the LGBT*IQ community, a rainbow flag was hoisted on the factory flagpole over the CSD weekend. Passers-by at Porscheplatz could also marvel at a mobile rainbow, as six brightly coloured 911s adorned the forecourt of the Porsche Museum. During the virtual Pride Run, members of the Porsche family set a sign: wearing coloured shirts, they covered kilometre after kilometre on their own choice of running routes in a display of solidarity with the rainbow community. During the virtual Pride Run, members of the Porsche family set a sign: wearing coloured shirts, they covered kilometre after kilometre on their own choice of running routes in a display of solidarity with the rainbow community. Targets for the percentage of women in the Supervisory Board, Board of Management and management In the course of implementing the law for the equal participation of women and men in management positions in the private sector, the following targets for the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board and Executive Board as well as the top management levels have been set for Porsche AG with a deadline of 31 December 2021: against the backdrop of the long-term commitments of its members, the Supervisory Board has confirmed the status quo of ten per cent as its target figure. At the time of this decision being made, the Executive Board positions for all departments are occupied exclusively by men with the respective contractual periods extending over several years. For this reason, the status quo (zero per cent) was set as the target for the Board. However, Porsches Supervisory Board has set itself the target of increasing the percentage of women over the long term. With regard to the first and second management levels below the Executive Board, Porsche AG has set a target of 15 per cent by 31 December 2021. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. Porsche mood barometer Once again in 2020, all employees of Porsche AG and its subsidiaries were asked to give an assessment of their current work situation using a mood barometer. More than 82 per cent of employees in the Porsche Group voluntarily took part in the survey, which took the form of an online questionnaire. The mood index at Porsche AG once again improved by 0.8 percentage points compared with the already very good results in 2019. It was particularly gratifying that 93 per cent of staff expressed the view that Porsche was a very attractive employer. After the questionnaires are evaluated, the results are discussed in detail within the respective organisation unit. Managers and employees identify potential for improvement and jointly define specific measures in order to optimise processes or working conditions, for example. Exclusive partnership with top universities Porsches Executive Leadership Garage qualification programme was launched during the reporting year. This builds on a research and transfer programme run by Leuphana University Luneburg with academics from Stanford University as exchange partners. Porsche AG is a founding member of the programme. Its aim is to bring together executives from national and international companies. It also strives to familiarise participants with the latest scientific findings and methods in dealing with digital transformation. This is achieved by combining the latest scientific findings from Silicon Valley, convincing business models from innovative start-ups and the participating executives own experiences. The programme consists of several modules that can be attended independently of each other. They include, for example, the Inside Silicon Valley module on the campus of Stanford University. Other modules focus on topics such as Artificial Intelligence and its impact on leadership, Data literacy and the critical examination of data and information and Digital change and the successful implementation of complex transformation projects. Cooperation projects with universities When it comes to promoting young talent, Porsche continues to back partnership-based cooperation with relevant higher education institutions and organisations. Examples include its cooperation with Formula Student Germany and the partnership with the business information systems and industrial engineering courses at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The existing cooperation agreements with CODE University in Berlin and the Leipzig Graduate School of Management (HHL) were extended in 2020. The cooperation in place with these universities aims to ensure that, during courses of study, science and practice are closely interlinked in the context of digitalisation. This also includes the scholarship programme for computer science students at RWTH Aachen University. Every year, 15 students from the computer science, media informatics, software systems engineering and data science courses receive a scholarship. International university contacts are also permanently being expanded. One such example is the cooperation with the IT chair at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj (Romania). Learning platform and media laboratory In 2020, the Porsche learning platform and media lab remained the central contact points for digital learning, enabling departments to independently design and produce digital learning formats with the support of HR development. Greater use has been made of this offering during the Covid-19 pandemic. The qualification portfolio, comprising offerings from Porsche AG and its subsidiaries, grew strongly this year. Particular support was given to virtual formats that support self-directed and remote learning. For example, Financial Processes at Porsche, a digital learning module aimed at all Porsche AG employees, was introduced to raise awareness of tax-related issues. In collaboration with the specialist departments and HR development, AI@Porsche was created as a further digital offering to introduce employees to the potential uses of artificial intelligence. Together with the Fit for Digit@l quiz app, this offering was awarded the Comenius-EduMedia-Award. Another exciting experiment was the design of a themed week as part of the Corporate Learning Communitys Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) 2020. An interdisciplinary team of qualification experts came together to discuss relevant questions concerning the Porsche Learning Lab, doing so in a virtual format and in an open exchange with numerous external HR experts. The attractiveness of Porsche as an employer is not only confirmed by graduates, but also by Porsche staff. Porsche remains a highly regarded employer In 2020, Porsche again scored very highly among students in relevant employer rankings. In the Universum Student Survey, Porsche was repeatedly named the most attractive company in the automotive industry and the most attractive employer for engineers in 2020. Porsche also achieved top results in the Trendence Institutes annual student survey, recording its best overall result from both rankings since 2006. The attractiveness of Porsche as an employer is not only confirmed by graduates, but also by Porsche staff. The sports car manufacturer came first in the Glassdoor Ranking for 2019/2020 and fourth at StepStone. Porsches high level of attractiveness as an employer is also demonstrated by the consistently high number of applicants. Its staff turnover rate remains well below one per cent. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. Down-to-earth, approachable  and not always perfect With its employer branding campaign, Porsche has been demonstrating since autumn 2018 that behind the exclusive products lies an approachable employer. High-quality black and white pictures of employees give an authentic impression of the working world at the sports car manufacturer. Key themes in Porsches corporate culture are conveyed to the outside world, including being down to earth, loyal and innovative. The story was developed further during 2020. Under the heading Bad days employees tell their stories, warts and all, explaining that their journey to mobility of the future is not always an easy one. Just like everywhere else, employees at Porsche also experience bad days, with difficult decisions to be made or seemingly insurmountable hurdles to overcome. These difficult days reveal more about a job than the easy times. And they also help Porsche employees to grow from their own mistakes. In an authentic way, the new employer branding campaign illustrates the culture of mistakes at Porsche, providing unusual insights into situations that are not necessarily expected. The campaign runs across all of Porsches personnel marketing social media channels at the same time, and is accompanied by advertisements and editorial contributions in print media. It makes people curious and gives potential applicants the opportunity to find out more about what it is like to work for Porsche. 20 years of the Ferry Porsche Prize Supporting young talent does not just begin at university. For the last 20 years, the best high-school leavers of the year in Baden-Wurttemberg have been awarded the Ferry Porsche Prize in the core subjects of mathematics, physics and technology. In 2020, 232 young people received the coveted award. Following a prize draw, six of them were awarded an additional one-year scholarship. The Ferry Porsche Prize is awarded jointly with the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport at StepStone in Baden-Wurttemberg. The intended aim is to increase the attractiveness of STEM subjects and encourage young people to study engineering. Employees at sites in Germany Other sites in Germany Schwarzenberg 674 474 Sachsenheim 541 Bietigheim 1,185 Ludwigsburg 3,504 Zuffenhausen Leipzig 15,181 4,340 Key themes in Porsches corporate culture are Weissach conveyed to the outside 6,762 world, including being down to earth, loyal and innovative. Year-on-year comparison Total workforce in Germany 2020 32,661 2019 31,690 +3% 2018 28,764 Employees, Society, Sports and Communications Back to work as a training organisation There were 143 young people who started their careers at Porsche in 2020 as apprentices or dual students. As in previous years, these new members of the Porsche family will be given a permanent employment contract on the successful completion of their training and studies. Training was another area that was strongly impacted by Covid-19 during the year under review. Technical vocational training, which focuses on teaching manual skills, relies particularly heavily on direct interaction between trainees and instructors in the workshop and training room. After detailed planning, the training centre was able to resume regular operations by the end of April, despite the pandemic. The specially developed digital teaching and learning offer was supplemented by additional modules for teaching at the vocational schools and training at the training centre. The use of tablets and e-learning was also continuously expanded. Consequently, the Open Day at the training centre also took the form of a digital InfoNight this year. And the traditional getting-to-know-you days for the new training year, which usually take place off-site, were also swiftly moved to the training centre and held in a new Covid-safe format. Selection process digitalised and optimised The entire process for selecting future apprentices and DHBW students was made even more transparent and easier to follow in 2020, with efficiencies made by moving more of the processes online. This optimisation ensures that Porsche will continue to find exactly the right young people for its needs in the future. After all, recruiting for Porsche vocational training does not simply mean selecting the best. It is about selecting those applicants who are the best fit for the sports car manufacturer, in other words, the young people who excel in how they behave at school, how they perform in core subjects such as mathematics and German, how they score in the recruitment test, and how they come across in the subsequent interview. As far as the technical occupations are concerned, 85 per cent are young people with a lower secondary school or intermediate school leaving certificate. They stand out thanks to their capacity to learn and motivation, but also on the basis of their technical skills and character. The aim is to keep them in the company for a long time after they have successfully completed their training and to develop them further in their professions. In order to achieve this aim in the future, the selection process has been optimised once again, taking all of these aspects into account. Porsche Gastronomy launches sustainability campaign Porsche Gastronomy supports Porsches sustainability strategy and is increasingly focusing on regional and seasonal ingredients. In this context, ten employee canteens were successfully certified according to the Baden-Wurttemberg Quality Mark (QZBW) in 2020. From now on, they will display the Taste the South quality mark. The next goal is certification level 2 with an even higher proportion of regionally produced ingredients. At the same time, Porsche Gastronomy has declared war on food waste: as part of a project in cooperation with United Against Waste e.V., the amount of food waste was analysed and measures to avoid waste devised. As a result, food waste has already been reduced by around 30 per cent. Across all canteen operations, this equates to almost 0.7 tonnes per day. In addition, Porsche Gastronomy was the first mass catering operation to switch all of its cleaning supplies to sustainable and biodegradable products. The environmental impact is significantly reduced but the cleaning effect remains the same. Another advantage is that hazards during cleaning activities are also significantly reduced. Creation of site fire service in Zuffenhausen In order to further strengthen the companys emergency response, the Executive Board decided during the year under review to establish a site fire service at its Zuffenhausen factory. Corporate Security was given the task of setting up the fire service, with a total of 35 full-time firefighters. By having its own fire service, Porsche is responding to the expansion of the plant in Zuffenhausen to accommodate production of the all-electric Taycan and the resulting increase in the number of high-voltage components. Response times would be reduced in the event of an emergency, and the companys own experts would be available immediately and with local knowledge. Chief electrician Given the increasing electrification of the Porsche model range as well as of buildings and facilities, a chief electrician (GvEFK) was appointed for the company in August 2020. As the central point of contact, the GvEFK is responsible for all internal and external topics relating to electrical safety. The GvEFK's remit is to establish a legally compliant organisation for electrical safety (vehicles, buildings and facilities) and to establish safe processes and standards wherever electrical current flows. The aim is to anchor awareness of electrical safety in the organisation on a long-term basis. On the basis of the statutory provisions and the requirements defined in state and professional association guidelines, as well as the regulations of the electrotechnical standard-setter VDE, the action required by Porsche is defined and measures rolled out accordingly, across all sites. The GvEFK is a staff function within Corporate Safety and manages more than 1,200 electrical specialists. Accident index remains stable Occupational safety remains another focus of health management. In 2020, the accident index was maintained at the previous year's level. Extensive training and awarenessraising as well as the implementation of sustainable measures are having the desired effect. There was a decrease in the severity of accidents compared with 2019, with a fall of 29 per cent. Accident severity is measured by the number of working days lost after an occupational accident. This figure also underlines the strong effort being made across all departments to improve health and safety. Porsche Gastronomy was the first mass catering operation to switch all of its cleaning supplies to sustainable and biodegradable products. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. SOCIETY With a diverse range of commitments to its name, Porsche strives to be a valued and responsible partner to society. The company actively supports socially disadvantaged groups, promotes culture and sports at its site locations, and is heavily involved in the spheres of education, environmental protection and biodiversity. In response to the huge impact of the coronavirus crisis on the more vulnerable sections of society, Porsche has significantly increased its support. Last year the company made donations to some 200 individual projects in a range of areas, while also engaging in CSR sponsorship and cultural sponsorship activities. Porsche also made further donations to the charitable Ferry Porsche Foundation. Emergency measures to tackle coronavirus Porsche has introduced wide-ranging measures in response to the coronavirus crisis, primarily in the regions in which it is based. Funding was boosted by a further five million euros, and grocery donations to food banks were more than doubled, targeting help at people suffering hardship as a result of the crisis. The company also supported numerous local aid organisations in their response to the pandemic, such as with the purchase of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) or targeted campaigns to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. The Gute(r)Dinge emergency aid fund, set up by the Burgerstiftung Stuttgart civic foundation, was one such project to receive funding from Porsche. The donations were aimed at helping people without a home in the Stuttgart region. Among the initiatives that benefited from support were a project to deliver food and personal hygiene items to homeless people by cargo bike, as well as providing hot meals. Porsche also supported the Caritasverband fur Stuttgart e.V.s disability charity to the tune of 70,000 euros. The money was used to buy equipment that was urgently needed to prevent the spread of coronavirus at the Caritas housing complex, which is home to around 170 residents and staff, in Zuffenhausen. Another project supported by Porsche during the year under review aims to protect children and young people. The Stuttgarter Jugendhaus gGmbH umbrella organisation received a donation of 110,000 euros to fund PPE during the pandemic. This donation safeguarded the running of 41 homes for children and young people in Stuttgart. As part of its relief measures, the sports car manufacturer also made an immediate donation of more than 210,000 euros to the Stiftung Evangelische Altenheimat. Some 580 elderly people in five care homes in Stuttgart and two additional sites in the Ludwigsburg area were provided with urgently required Personal Protective Equipment as a result. Hospitals and its staff ensure that people receive medical care. In order to cope with the enormous challenges posed by coronavirus, Porsche set up a lagship project worth 1.3 million euros for the benefit of Stuttgart hospitals: Stuttgart Hospital received an emergency aid donation of 810,000 euros. This money was used to purchase 20 anaesthetic machines, 21 ventilators and additional endoscopes for intubation for the Katharinenhospital, the Bad Cannstatt Hospital and Germanys largest childrens hospital, the Olgahospital. The funding was also used to buy laboratory equipment for the detection of coronavirus in DNA samples. Porsche donated a further 500,000 euros to the Marienhospital in Stuttgart. This emergency funding enabled the hospital to buy a mobile x-ray machine, along with 15,000 FFP2 face masks and 100,000 premium-grade surgical masks. The donation also funded the purchase of 30 infusers, which are used as dosing pumps for the continuous injection of medication. COLLABORATING IN OUR SOCIETY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. INDUSTRY, POLITICS AND SOCIETY: TOGETHER WE BEAT THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS. PORSCHE TAKES ITS SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY. THIS IS ONE OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND REFLECTS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SUSTAINABILITY. Oliver Blume, Chairman of the Executive Board Porsche launched a flagship project in Leipzig too, donating close to one million euros to social and medical institutions. Of this amount, 526,000 euros went to the University Hospital, which used the money to purchase eleven ventilators, two blood gas analysers and additional stocks of protective masks and face shields. In total, Porsche supported 19 institutions and social work associations in Leipzig, including the Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe accident support organisation, the German Red Cross (DRK), the Diakonie social welfare organisation, the childrens clinic at the University Hospital Leipzig (Stiftung Kinderklinik Universitatsklinikum Leipzig) and Herbie e.V. Approximately 30,000 euros was given to charitable organisations in Schwarzenberg, with the money being invested in urgently needed Personal Protective Equipment. The recipients in this case were the DRK, the Diakonische Werk social welfare organisation, the Lebenshilfe charity and the local food bank. Meanwhile, through digital networking, Porsche has also been taking a stand against loneliness and isolation. The company donated 125,000 euros to a project organised by the Federal Association of Protestant Aid for the Disabled. Almost 50 institutions in Baden-Wurttemberg and Saxony were given digital devices, as well as the necessary software and basic digital skills training. In this way, people with disabilities were able to connect online and continue to participate in society despite the restrictions on meeting up in person. Meanwhile, the subsidiaries have also been getting involved in efforts to tackle Covid-19. Porsche Consulting and MHP, for example, contributed their comprehensive consulting expertise to support the state governments crisis teams in Baden-Wurttemberg and Saxony. The sales company Porsche Deutschland supported the DRK Stuttgart and the Wohlfahrtswerk Stuttgart with donations and the delivery of supplies in the region. To take just one example, Porsche sports cars were used to deliver meals to care facilities and to drop off protective clothing and masks. Before Christmas, Porsche Deutschland made a further 50,000 euros donation to the global coronavirus emergency assistance organisation Aktion Deutschland Hilft e.V. For their part, the international subsidiaries also simply got on with supporting their local organisations on a voluntary basis. A few examples: Porsche Italia, together with the Italian dealer network, donated 1.3 million euros to Caritas Italiana as part of the Uniti per Ripartire campaign. More than 30,000 families received food vouchers and 5,000 schoolage children were given devices to help with remote learning. Porsche Iberica stepped in to help people particularly affected by the crisis, providing food and meals. Meals were prepared in the Porsche canteen in Madrid and served to the elderly or donated to the non-profit organisation FESBAL. Porsche Cars North America (PCNA) auctioned off the last 911 (type 991) to be built, raising 500,000 US dollars during a seven-day online auction. The Porsche subsidiary then doubled the amount to one million dollars before donating the money to United Way Worldwide, an organisation that actively provides Covid-19 assistance in the US. North American food banks were unable to meet the increased demand triggered by the pandemic. The Goodr Initiative responded to this problem, supporting families in need with pop-up grocery shops. PCNA supported this initiative at the Porsche sites in Atlanta and Los Angeles. Approximately 1,000 families benefited as a result. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. Further donations Children and young people Porsche trainees have shown exceptional commitment to a good cause. Last year, they presented the Forderkreis krebskranke Kinder Stuttgart e.V., a childrens cancer charity, with a cheque for 10,000 euros. The money was the proceeds of a raffle held by the trainees during their Christmas party at the Porsche training centre. The Youth and Trainee Council (JAV) and the Works Council have been organising the raffle for the benefit of the cancer charity for many years now. The Leseohren association aims to instil a love of language and reading in children. Almost 600 reading mentors volunteer in Stuttgarts childcare centres, libraries and schools. Reading a story aloud helps children to develop a range of skills. The coronavirus crisis sparked many offers of online support for children and young people as they worked on their reading at home. Porsche played its part by making a donation to help with this online provision. The company is also involved with the German Road Safety Association in Baden-Wurttemberg, providing cycling proficiency training at all of the primary schools in the state. Traffic safety training, delivered at training centres or by trainers who visit schools, plays a key role in keeping children safe when out and about on the roads. A smile for company children with other strengths (Lukas) is Porsches own initiative. The aim is to help employees children with serious mental or physical disabilities who require special support. Porsche helps to fund integrative kindergartens as well as care centres and all-day nurseries that provide childcare for employees' children. Youth and training support Porsche Junior improves the prospects of young people in the labour market. This social welfare project gives young people opportunities to gain important practical experience before starting a traineeship. Porsche has been supporting this project since 2011 and donated 30,000 euros during the reporting year. The sports car manufacturer also supports the Joblinge programme, which provided approximately 700 disadvantaged young people from the Stuttgart region with a place on a training scheme. Porsche also contributed 30,000 euros to the Stuttgart training campus, a learning and advice centre that brings together all of the institutions involved in the training process in order to help refugees and other young people with support needs find a route into working life. As well as helping the young people to apply for a job, the campus also provides mentoring, extra tuition and language classes. The GaraGe training initiative is based at the Technology Centre for Young People in the Plagwitz district of Leipzig, and is used by more than 80,000 children and young people every year. Porsches Technology Workshop, featuring a 911 Turbo, forms part of the Centre. Using the car as a real-life example, a Porsche employee introduces the young people to the world of automotive technology. Porsche Leipzig has been involved in the GaraGe project for 20 years now. Aces for charity As part of the Aces for Charity campaign at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, the company donated 50 euros for every ace hit during the German Ladies Series presented by Porsche. The German Tennis Federation launched this tournament series last year with the help of Porsche when tournaments were put on hold worldwide due to Covid-19. The players served a total of 385 aces  and Porsche generously rounded up the donated sum to 20,000 euros. This amount was split equally between two causes: the Agapedia Foundation, which runs various support projects for children who are in need or facing hardship, and the Baden-Wurttemberg Sports Federation, where the money was used in the Integration through sports federal programme. Porsche Junior improves the prospects ofyoung people in the labour market. This social welfare project gives young people opportunities to gain important practical experience before starting a traineeship. International commitments Porsche and its national organisations are involved in projects all over the world. Porsche China, for example, once again launched the Dealer CSR Fund in 2020, supporting local projects throughout China. The project proposals are submitted by Porsche dealers and implemented in collaboration with nonprofit organisations. In 2020, Porsche China supported the Mini Libraries & Reading Space in Rural Schools project and the Care for Kids - Anti Kidnapping Educational programme. Through its CSR campaign Porsche Do Dream, Porsche Korea aims to open up new opportunities and prospects to disadvantaged children and young people. One part of this programme is Porsche Dream-up, a scholarship initiative for particularly talented young people in the fields of art and sports. Dream Playground creates play opportunities inside buildings. The background to this is that heavy fine dust pollution in many areas of Korea prevents children from playing outdoors. Six indoor playgrounds have already been built at Korean primary schools. Other projects under this initiative include Porsche Dream Circle for environmental education in schools, Urban Bees Seoul, a honeybee project for greater biodiversity in Seoul, Seoul Bike X Art Collaboration, an art project for bike sharing in Seoul City, and aid projects for families and artists who have been disadvantaged by the Corona crisis. Porsche Latin America has been working with the charitable organisation Un Techo since 2012. This Latin American non-governmental organisation works to help socially vulnerable families in marginalised neighbourhoods, provides housing in areas of extreme poverty and also offers educational programmes. The donation made in the reporting year will be used to fund at least 50 houses in 14 Latin American countries. CSR sponsorship Funding of foundation chairs Through its CSR campaign Porsche also supports academic education Porsche Do Dream through donations and works together with Porsche Korea aims to open institutions of higher education. To take an example, the Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG Chair up new opportunities and of Strategic Management and Digital Entre prospects to disadvantaged preneurship was created in July 2013 at the children and young people. HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management. By the end of 2020 more than 2,500 students had already benefited from the courses, seminars and projects on offer. The company also supports teaching, research and continuing academic development in the field of modularisation in vehicle development at Esslingen University of Applied Sciences. Start-up contest for school pupils and trainees Jugend grundet is a business plan and simulation contest organised by the Steinbeis Innovation Centre for Business Development at Pforzheim University Last year, more than 4,100 trainees and school pupils from year 10 and above from all over Germany submitted their start-up proposals. Porsche has been the main sponsor of the contest since 2016 and also awarded its special Digital Future prize for the second time in 2020. Three school pupils from a high school in Achern won over the judging panel with their E-ChargeNets GmbH start-up. This e-charging and billing concept uses public energy sources, such as street lamps, as charging stations for private e-vehicles. The winners prize was a visit to Porsche Digital in Berlin. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. Youth development in sports Supporting young people in sports is a fundamental element of Porsches philosophy of social responsibility. For many years now, the company has been supporting youth work in sports clubs within the context of its wider Turbo for Talents initiative. One particular focus is how to balance school, sports and working life. The programme also promotes social aspects and the teaching of values such as team spirit, fairness, passion and respect as well as the development of personalities. The Germany-wide CSR programme focuses on the Porsche site locations of Stuttgart and Leipzig. Since September, Porsche has also been involved in youth development work at Borussia Monchengladbach. Stuttgart region In the Stuttgart region, Porsche has been supporting children and young people at its partner clubs SC Bietigheim-Bissingen Steelers (ice hockey), SV Stuttgarter Kickers, SG Sonnenhof Groaspach (football) and the Porsche Basketball Academy Ludwigsburg for several years. In September 2020, twelve talented and dedicated young athletes were honoured with the Porsche Turbo Awards. At the awards ceremony in the Porsche Museum, these talented youngsters from local partner clubs were honoured in three categories. The award winners were recognised for their sporting and academic excellence during the past season and for their commitment and exemplary conduct within their teams and clubs. Leipzig region Porsche expanded its commitment to Bundesliga football club RB Leipzig in 2020. As a strategic partner of the club s youth section, the sports car manufacturer is now also the sleeve sponsor for the jerseys worn by the U15 to U19 teams. Porsche has been supporting the youth work of the Red Bulls since 2014. Through this additional youth sponsorship, the company wants to continue to be an active trailblazer for up-and-coming talent. The cooperation venture makes it easier for children from socially disadvantaged families to access sports. Porsche pays their fees for attending the RB Leipzig Football School. At the football camps, girls and boys can show off their skills and learn a lot about football in a fun environment. Working together and in cooperation with the Berufsbildungswerk Leipzig (BBW) vocational training centre, Porsche and RB Leipzig are committed to inclusion and integration: at the football schools inclusive camp, children with and without disabilities or migration backgrounds learn from and with each other. Every year for the past six years, the best young team from the Red Bulls has been crowned the Porsche Talent Team. In 2020, the U17s were delighted to win this title. The award honours young players for outstanding academic and sporting achievements and for their team spirit. The company ensures that Leipzig fans, social institutions and employees can all get involved too, with ticket allocations and campaigns. On the Porsche Coaching Bench, families and their football-mad children can support their team at every Bundesliga home match directly from the sidelines. The professional players are also regular guests at Meet & Greet events and share their knowledge with the young fans. Children between the ages of five and ten also have the chance to be a Porsche match mascot and enter the stadium alongside their heroes at home games. West region The new partnership with Borussia Monchengladbach at the start of the 2020/2021 season means that Porsche youth sponsorship will also be represented in the west of Germany for the first time. In this way, the premium manufacturer is aiming to expand its social commitment across regional boundaries. At Borussia, Porsche sponsors the youth programme and lends its name to the renowned Foal Stable boarding school for young talent. In addition, Porsche's youth sponsorship programme Turbo for Talents features on advertising boards at the Bundesliga home games of the first division club. In addition to promoting talent, successfully combining sports, school and leisure time is another important issue for both partners. This has already been successfully implemented for several years at the Monchengladbach boarding school, the Porsche Foal Stable. Joint courses for the professional training of talented young players are also planned. The programme covers aspects including social media, how to apply for jobs, and child protection as well as the prevention of doping, racism and gambling addiction. Cultural sponsorship Wagner 22 festival Porsche and the Leipzig Opera have launched a joint partnership: looking ahead to summer 2022, the cultural institution is inviting Wagner lovers from all over the world to its Wagner 22 festival. All of the German composers operas will be performed in the space of the three-week event. Joint planning for this major celebration has already begun, and Porsche is supporting the event as the title sponsor. The aim is to make culture accessible to everyone and to create unforgettable musical experiences in the heart of Leipzigs city centre. The partnership with Porsche enables Wagner fans and anyone with an interest in opera to attend the performances free of charge: organisers plan to broadcast two of the operas in the Augustusplatz square. Open-air cinema and classical concerts in Leipzig Event cancellations and the closure of leisure attractions dominated 2020. Porsche Leipzig found a fitting response. Roadmovies was the name given to a new event format in the customer centre  a drive-in cinema on the stage normally reserved for sports cars. There were no issues with maintaining social distance, and room for 200 vehicles at each showing on the impressive 144 square metre screen. With more than 2,400 attendees, Roadmovies proved to be a successful format. One of the programme highlights was a stream of the best bits of the popular openair concerts held in the Rosental featuring the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra from recent years. These concerts also had to be cancelled in 2020 due to coronavirus. The drive-in cinema provided safe entertainment in a special atmosphere. Porsche has been a partner of the Gewandhaus Orchestra since 2011, focusing on the Klassik airleben open-air concert events since 2014. Stuttgart Ballet Porsche extended its commitment as the principal sponsor of the Stuttgart Ballet in June 2020. The new contract runs until 2023 and also includes the presentation of the Ballet in the Park cultural event. Due to the pandemic, the Stuttgart Ballet and the sports car manufacturer joined forces to create an alternative to the cancelled open-air event Ballet in the Park: on 25 July, the premiere of the ballet evening \\\"RESPONSE I\\\", supported by Porsche, was performed in the opera house in front of a socially distanced audience of 249 people. The performance was also broadcast live and with free admission on the BW-Bank Kulturwasen big screen in Cannstatt. With parking spaces for around 1,000 vehicles, more than 2,000 people were able to enjoy the premiere from the comfort of their cars. Another 250 people were able to watch from deck chairs. In this way, the Stuttgart Ballet remained true to its motto of Ballet for all. One month earlier, the new building housing the John Cranko School was completed. The School has been attracting exceptional ballet talent from all over the world for decades. Porsche provided significant support for the project with a donation of ten million euros. The funding was provided through a foundation that the sports car manufacturer established in 2013 together with the city of Stuttgart. The Schools new home is an impressive tiered structure over ten floors. It is big enough to accommodate and train up to 150 young dancers in the future. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. Ferry Porsche Foundation The Ferry Porsche Foundation, established in 2018, also focuses on a broad range of social responsibilities. Its main focus is support for children and young people, mainly in and around the companys factory sites, where the foundation supports projects in science, research, training, schooling and education. It also supports initiatives in the areas of culture and environmental conservation and helps people who find themselves in social need. Even in such a turbulent year as 2020, the Ferry Porsche Foundation was able to make an important contribution to the community and assume social responsibility through its own programmes and sponsorships. Despite not being able to hold its usual 6-hour race, the Foundation was still able to support six everyday heroes in the form of charitable institutions and associations by donating a total of 200,000 euros. The Olgale Foundation for Sick Children, the Stuttgart Children's and Youth Hospice, the Gustav Werner School in Zuffenhausen, the Neuwirtshaus School in Zuffenhausen, the Fruhstuck fur Kinder Association that provides breakfasts to schoolchildren, and the Lebenshilfe Stuttgart organisation were once again delighted to receive donations of 33,333 euros each. In December, in honour of the 111th anniversary of the birth of Prof. Ferdinand Ferry Porsche, the Foundation donated 5,000 euros to 111 food banks in Germany, making a total donation of 550,000 euros. In keeping with the motto Ferry Porsche educates, the Foundation provided around one million euros, as it did in 2019, in support of gifted students at schools in the Stuttgart area, for environmental education projects, for inclusion in sports and for the education of children and young people with social and health-related disadvantages. The objectives are to promote young talent, to share knowledge and to give socially disadvantaged people access to qualifications and training opportunities. Three new activities of the Foundation: As part of its cultural sponsorship at the companys factory locations, it has been supporting a scholarship programme at the John Cranko School since last year. The Ferry Porsche Challenge was held for the first time. This non-profit fundraising competition supported 70 sustainable projects, creative ideas and new initiatives with a total of 1.5 million euros  500,000 euros more than originally planned. Around 600 projects in the Stuttgart and Leipzig area had applied for funding. The Ferry Porsche Challenge 2021 launched in November under the motto Making schools digital. This time, it is aimed at digital projects from schools in Baden-Wurttemberg and Saxony, for which an amount of one million euros has been earmarked. The foundation is also active internationally: in cooperation with SOS Childrens Villages, it set up a digital education project in Sao Paulo (Brazil) and also provided support there in the form of basic food and personal hygiene items. FERRY PORSCHE CHALLENGE WE SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO NEED OUR HELP. IN A FIGURATIVE SENSE, THE FERRY PORSCHE CHALLENGE IS A BRIDGE THAT MAKES LIFE MORE WORTH LIVING. FOR US, ITS ABOUT CREATING SOCIAL IMPETUS: TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR OTHERS, VOLUNTEERING, REALISING PROJECTS SUSTAINABLY. THESE ARE THE VALUES THAT FERRY PORSCHE, WHOSE NAME WE BEAR, EMBODIES. Dr Sebastian Rudolph, Chairman of the Ferry Porsche Foundation 63 bee colonies at Porsche sites More than 3.5 million honey bees live at Porsches sites. In May 2020, 13 colonies were introduced to the Zuffenhausen site, each with a population of around 50,000 bees. The measure forms part of the companys commitment to nature and species conservation. At Porsches Leipzig plant, a total of 50 bee colonies have occupied the wilderness of the offroad area since 2017. The honey produced by the Porsche colonies is sold under the name Turbienchen at the employee shops at both sites, in the Porsche Museum and at the Porsche Shop in Leipzig. Biodiversity Biodiversity at the Porsche factory in Leipzig Last year saw a new addition to the Porsche safari on the Leipzig factory premises with a Bat Night. School classes, children and families have been enjoying safari trips to the premises since 2018. The 132-hectare natural area is home to 75 wild oxen and 30 Exmoor ponies as well as numerous wild animals such as pheasants, black kites, roe deer, brown hares, bats and amphibians. Three million honey bees have also been living on the nature reserve since 2017. Visitors who take part in the Porsche Safari learn a lot about the native flora and fauna along an approximately four-kilometre-long hiking trail, accompanied by environmental educators from the cooperation partner Auwaldstation Leipzig. These discovery tours have already attracted approximately 1,200 participants over the past three years. This measure reflects the commitment of the company to nature and species conservation. PROJECT MANAGER NORA LOGES AND BEE-KEEPER FRANK GEGGUS SPORTS Social commitment and activities in the sporting arena go hand in hand at Porsche. The companys diverse and sustainable commitment to sports is also anchored in its sports sponsorship strategy. The company uses various platforms for traditional brand communication and for special experiences. Porsche has, for example, been the organiser of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix since 2002 and the title sponsor of the Porsche European Open since 2015. In this way, the company brings annual sporting highlights to tennis and golf fans and the Stuttgart and Hamburg regions. Tennis Porsche has been involved in womens tennis since 1978, when it became the title partner of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix during its first staging in Filderstadt, before also taking on the role of tournament promoter in 2002. Since then, the company has expanded its involvement in tennis considerably worldwide. In addition to its own WTA tournament held at the Porsche Arena in Stuttgart, the premium manufacturer has supported other WTA tournaments in the capacity of automobile partner in recent years and is the title sponsor of the Porsche Race to Shenzhen, the official season-long race to qualify for the WTA Finals. Due to the coronavirus crisis, the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix and the Porsche-sponsored WTA Finals tournament in Shenzhen had to be cancelled for the first time in their history. Despite the difficult year, Porsche was present at four WTA tournaments during 2020, albeit without any spectators in two cases, namely the Western & Southern Open in New York and the tournament in Linz, Austria. In this way, the company has once again underlined how relevant tennis is. Social commitment and activities on the sports field go hand-in-hand at Porsche. The reporting year also saw the first staging of a new tournament series in Germany. As part of its long-standing partnership with the German Tennis Federation (DTB), Porsche supported the German Ladies Series presented by Porsche. This tournament series, which was held over several weeks due to the worldwide tournament hiatus caused by Covid-19, helped a large number of German professionals to gain matchplay experience and to continue to pursue their profession. Also featuring in the draws were numerous players from the DTB junior teams, the Porsche Talent Team and the Porsche Junior Team as well as three members of the Porsche Team Germany: Laura Siegemund, Anna-Lena Friedsam and Mona Barthel. The fact that Porsche is now also playing a major role in this new tournament series as part of its long-standing partnership with the DTB and its involvement with the national German tennis centres in Stuttgart and Kamen demonstrates the companys sustained commitment to German womens tennis and to supporting up-and-coming players. Particularly now, in such challenging times, this close cooperation with our partner is so important, explained Barbara Rittner, Head of Womens Tennis at the German Tennis Federation. The excellent tie-up between sports and social commitment was also demonstrated by the Aces for Charity initiative, as a result of which Porsche donated a total of 20,000 euros to social causes. Porsche and the DTB also announced the extension of their successful cooperation in December. This partnership, which has been in place since 2012, includes support for Porsche Team Germany in the Billie Jean King Cup (formerly the Fed Cup) as well as for the new generation of female players in the Porsche Talent Team and Porsche Junior Team. The faces of Porsches successful commitment to womens tennis are Angelique Kerber, as well as Julia Gorges and Maria Sharapova, who both retired from the womens tour in 2020. These women are known for their class and personality on and off the court, and represent Porsche and its philosophy as brand ambassadors on the global stage. Golf Golf is another sports with a long tradition at Porsche. More than 30 years ago, the company launched the Porsche Golf Cup for its customers in Germany. The international growth of this exclusive series of amateur tournaments demonstrated just how popular golf is among the target group and also inspired Porsche to become involved with mens professional golf, as title partner in the Porsche European Open. After Porsche revived the prestigious European Open in 2015, the sixth edition of the traditional tournament of the European Tour and the fourth in the Hamburg metropolitan region was cancelled this year due to the pandemic. Likewise, the Porsche Golf Cup could not be held this season. As part of its partnership with the European Tour, however, Porsche was involved in the newly created UK Swing with six consecutive tournaments in the UK and the Golf for Good charity initiative during the year under review. In the autumn, Porsche reaffirmed its commitment to golf, extending its title sponsorship of the Porsche European Open for a further three years until 2023. From 3 to 6 June 2021, world-class golfers will once again tee off on the Porsche North Course at the Green Eagle Golf Courses just outside Hamburg. World-class British golfer Paul Casey competed as a Porsche brand ambassador for the first time at the US Open in September, the second major tournament of the year. The Englishman is the first brand ambassador from the world of golf. He has been among the worlds top players for almost two decades, climbing as high as number three in the world rankings, most recently featuring as a regular in the top 20, and has won the Ryder Cup three times. Casey won his 19th professional title at the Porsche European Open 2019, which Porsche has supported as title sponsor since 2015. Casey thrilled the fans attending the tournament in Hamburg with a performance that was characterised by his infectious passion for the event. For example, he spent an entertaining evening with members of the Porsche Golf Circle Community during the week-long competition. Casey has had the Porsche logo displayed on his bag since the US Open and, alongside the Taycan, was the main face of the international Make it happen golf campaign. The campaign provides a credible illustration of how dreams can come true  even as a child, the 43-yearold wanted to become a professional golfer and drive a Porsche. World-class British golfer Paul Casey teed off at the US Open in September, the second major of the year, as a Porsche brand ambassador for the first time. Forming part of the Porsche family, Porsches brand ambassadors are selected strategically and appear in targeted internal and external PR and marketing communications. They lend a personal touch and give a special profile to the companys unique products and to the company as a whole. Their involvement in events heightens the attendees experience and boosts coverage in the media and public domain. In 2020, Paul Casey became the first ambassador from the world of golf to join the Porsche family. Tennis superstar Maria Sharapova is another brand ambassador, alongside the two best German players on the womens tour over recent years, Angelique Kerber and Julia Gorges. From the world of football, Sami Khedira, a member of Germanys World Cup-winning side, is an ambassador for Porsche youth development. Brand ambassadors for the sports car manufacturer in 2020 also included German rally driver Walter Rohrl, Australian World Endurance Champion Mark Webber, and twotime Norwegian Olympic champion Aksel Lund Svindal, as well as actor Richy Muller and musician Udo Lindenberg, all of whom featured in Porsches corporate and product communications. Two former Porsche works drivers also perform the role of brand ambassador: GT specialist and development driver Jorg Bergmeister and the two-time Le Mans winner Timo Bernhard. As one of the most successful The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. endurance racers of all time, Timo Bernhard is advice to #stayathome.

RICHY MULLER UDO LINDENBERG COMMUNICATIONS Cementing a credible reputation Reputation is key to Porsche's long-term business success, and communication provides the central foundation. It reinforces the public image and social acceptance of the brand, the company and its products. And thus creates meaning and value. Given the importance of communication, the sports car manufacturer introduced a reputation analysis in 2020, to measure progress. At Porsche, global communication is strategically managed and operationally implemented through the Communications, Sustainability and Politics division. This is where the companys diverse communication measures are designed, pooled, harmonised and tailored to the relevant target groups, markets and channels. Measures address all internal and external stakeholders, from the media and politicians, to interest groups, society and Porsche employees. Sustainability is a fundamental pillar of the Porsche strategy. Consequently, it also plays an outstanding role in communications. It contributes significantly to Porsches excellent reputation. The division organises the dialogue with stakeholders, the exchange of information through networks and the integration of the Porsche Sustainability Council, which comprises renowned independent experts. Authenticity and transparency improve the companys credibility and create a basis of confidence for open dialogue with stakeholders. Credibility creates confidence Authenticity and transparency improve the companys credibility and create a basis of confidence for open dialogue with stakeholders. Internally, this is reflected in a corporate culture that values openness, responsibility and mutual admiration. Externally, the excellent quality of the operational communication activities means that the information published by Porsche is highly regarded. During the year under review, Porsche Communications published just under 450 press releases. Globally, the company successfully placed its products and stories on 95 front pages. This earned Porsche a PR value of 1.377billion euros. The PR value reflects the added value of effective communication work. Focus on the product Product communication plays a significant role, especially as part of the introduction of new models. To generate high public awareness in anticipation of the commercial launch, new products are presented to international media in advance, at motor shows and the companys own premieres. Automotive journalists get to experience new models up close, putting them through their paces at driving events. Technology workshops allow the sports car manufacturer to present its latest innovations. In 2020, Porsche unveiled many new models in international markets. The first major press driving event took place in February. The Estoril circuit in Portugal was the backdrop as the company presented its new Macan GTS, 718 Boxster GTS 4.0 and Cayman GTS 4.0 models. Around 250 journalists from around the world put the vehicles through extensive tests. Resolute digitalisation The year under review presented exceptional challenges for Porsche Communications. The coronavirus crisis rewrote the rules of the game. The first major events were already being cancelled in late February. Then, government public health measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 brought motor shows and press driving events to a complete halt. Porsches communication experts came up with innovative solutions in this new normal, quickly developing a range of new digital formats. The world premiere of the 911 Turbo S, for example, took place not at the Geneva International Motor Show as planned, but online, as a virtual event. With great success. More than 5.4 million viewers followed the live broadcast of the premiere on the web. Over 900 press articles have been published about the new top-of-the-range 911 model. Porsches corporate communications were also affected by the pandemic. The annual press conference scheduled for 20 March had to be moved online at short notice. To great acclaim as it turned out, with more than 5,250 international journalists logging in to the live stream with Oliver Blume (Chairman of the Executive Board) and his deputy Lutz Meschke (Member of the Executive Board for Finance and IT). Over the following days, the video notched up 1.6 million views. There were more than 100 press articles around the world covering the content of the presentation. Porsches communication experts came up with innovative solutions in this new normal, quickly developing a range of new digital formats. Innovative communication concept Press events around the planned world premieres of the new Porsche 911 Targa and Porsche 911 Targa 4S Heritage Design Edition also had to be cancelled. Instead, Porsche developed an innovative integrated communication concept in their place. This makes much greater use of digital content, alongside the traditional measures. Three new episodes were commissioned as part of the well-established 9:11 Magazine web TV format. The three-part show provided additional information as well as content with emotional appeal for editorials and reporting. More than 120,000 viewers worldwide followed the online presentation of the two 911 models via a range of channels. It was not until mid-June that the first live driving event could take place again. Automotive journalists took the Cayenne GTS and Cayenne GTS Coupe for a spin around Zuffenhausen. One month later, experts from the media were able to test the 911 Targa 4, the 911 Targa 4S and the 911 Targa 4S Heritage Design Edition on the tarmac outside Stuttgart. In September, Porsche issued an invitation to the Bilster Berg circuit in Bad Driburg. At the event, accredited experts from the media were given a more detailed look at the development of the second-generation Panamera. They were able to drive the Panamera, Panamera 4, Panamera 4S E-Hybrid, Panamera GTS and Panamera Turbo S variants. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. Live digital format Twelve months after the world premiere of the Taycan, a new live digital format Talk Electric was launched in September. In conversation with an expert motor journalist, a Porsche specialist presented the technical details and future prospects for the companys first all-electric sports car. In an interview, Executive Board Member for Development Michael Steiner explained the contribution made by synthetic fuels to the sustainable decarbonisation of vehicles with combustion engines. Another edition of Talk Electric focused on the topics of range and charging. Journalists participated in the live show online, asking their questions through a chat function. The Talk Electric interviews were all recorded and presented at a digital press conference for the Taycan Regional Tour in Germany at the end of September. The tour took in the Hockenheimring, Munich, Leipzig and Hamburg. Regional media experts in each location were given the chance to try out the innovative Porsche electric sports cars for themselves. In late October/early November, the company invited selected journalists to the Hockenheimring, where the 911 Turbo Coupe and Cabriolet were presented. At the same time, the 718 Cayman GT4 and 718 Spider, two models from the 718 series that feature the Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) transmission, were introduced. Later that month, towards the end of November, Porsche welcomed members of the press to an event in the Munich area. Three hybrid versions from the next generation Panamera series were put under the lens: the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid, the Panamera 4S E-Hybrid and the Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid. Porsche is also systematically making its product presentations more sustainable. Now, it uses Augmented Reality technology to present its technologies in fine detail in a virtual environment. AUGMENTED REALITY Augmented Reality Porsche is also systematically making its product presentations more sustainable: at driving events, it has been common until now to demonstrate technical components such as engines and transmissions. These all had to be transported to the event. Recently, the communications division launched a pilot project with the aim of reducing the carbon footprint of its events. Now, it uses Augmented Reality (AR) technology to present its technologies in fine detail in a virtual environment. Smart phone apps render the associated animations in real time. As a result, the actual components no longer need to be transported and the carbon emissions associated with these events can be significantly reduced. At the same time, by means of AR technology journalists can create even more enticing and interesting audiovisual content. For example, they can use their smart phone camera to record video of the Porsche Taycan. An app on the phone enables an AR layer and adds graphics that show key information such as vehicle specifications. It is even possible to place the electric sports car virtually in a completely different environment, such as on a race track or cruising down the strip. Another function is the transparency mode: A transparent clone of the vehicle is displayed next to the actual car, allowing the viewer to see inside and examine the technology under the skin, such as the drivetrain or chassis. First-hand information The Porsche Newsroom is a central information platform that serves journalists from across the globe as the first point of contact for news about the company and its products. In addition, the public at large are increasingly using the newsroom.porsche.com website to get information first-hand. During the Covid-19 crisis, the newsrooms editorial team created added value with their #GetCreativeWithPorsche lockdown campaign. Well-known experts contributed their hints and inspiration on how to get through lockdown. For example, Porsche Chief Designer Michael Mauer shared how to draw a 911. Brand ambassadors also got in on the act with Mark Webber providing workout advice and Maria Sharapova gave tips on healthy eating. And champion sim racer Max Benecke revealed the challenges of virtual motorsports. The Porsche Newsroom published 713 articles in the year under review. More than 6.1 million page impressions were clocked up by 3.4 million visitors in total. The information was offered in versions for ten different markets: US, China, Germany, Russia, Switzerland, France, Spain, Latin America, Australia and International. The Porsche Newsroom published 713 articles in the year under review. More than 6.1 million page impressions were clocked up by 3.4 million visitors in total. Targeted communication Direct communications through social media are becoming increasingly important. Far-reaching profiles on Twitter, Instagram and Drivetribe all contribute to the success of Porsches communications. Porsche registered 1.2 million followers on its Newsroom channel on Instagram during the year under review, achieving some 150 million impressions. The company recorded 36.4 million impressions through Drivetribe. Twitter contributed 590,000 followers with 17.3 million impressions. Across all of its social media channels in 2020, Porsche achieved a total of 288 million impressions and had some three million followers. Launched in November 2018, the Porsche NewsTV web channel also enjoys high numbers of views for its attractive and informative video streams. The platform brings together exclusive video content from the sports car manufacturer for journalists, bloggers and the online community. A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is used to ensure that the videos are distributed quickly around the world. At the end of August, the new Panamera celebrated its world premiere on NewsTV. The bilingual broadcast in German and English reached approaching 100,000 viewers. The web video series DANCE  inspired by Porsche was honoured with the International Communicators Award of the Academy of Interactive & Visual Arts in two categories during the year under review. The format won both the Award of Excellence and the Award of Distinction. The video series featuring global ballet star Friedemann Vogel focused on the fascinating power of dynamic movement, both in dance and when driving a Porsche sports car. THE PORSCHE NEWSROOM IS THE CENTRAL INFORMATION PLATFORM FOR JOURNALISTS AND THE PUBLIC ALIKE The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. PORSCHE CHRISTOPHORUS Sustainable print format Porsches flagship communication is Christophorus. The magazine has a long-standing tradition, engaging Porsche customers and interested members of the public since 1952. The four editions published in the year under review appeared in 13 languages with a global print run of 600,000 copies per edition. Porsche also publishes the magazine content online, in all of the available languages. The web version at christophorus.porsche.com includes additional photography alongside the articles from the print magazine. Sustainability plays a key role in the magazines production. Christophorus is printed on FSC-certified paper using the latest processes. A combined heat and power (CHP) source ensures that up to 52 per cent less CO2 is emitted compared with traditional printing processes. During the reporting year, Christophorus was recognised with several awards. Issue 391 took the German Design Award 2020 in the Excellent Communications Design Editorial category. With issue 393, Porsche not only won gold and silver in the Best of Content Marketing Award 2020, but was also named the winner of the German Brand Award. Finally, the XL Special Christophorus Edition The People Issue won the Automotive Brand Contest. Enhanced with online video The 9:11 digital video channel is the multimedia partner to Christophorus. The online magazine show provides exactly nine minutes and eleven seconds of captivating audio and video footage featuring peoples love of all things Porsche. 9:11 has a deep commitment to journalistic story-telling. Each edition is based around a particular theme. The topics given the multimedia treatment range from highlights of the past through to Porsche of the future. Journalists and online distributors are welcome to use the content in their own media. As in the previous year, 9:11 won a number of prizes again in 2020. Two video articles were honoured with the Best of Content Award 2020. The gold medal went to Freedom to the power of 911, while silver was won by an article explaining the innovative hairpin technology in the Porsche Taycans electric motor. Prizes in the Automotive Brand Contest 2020 went to the Taycan, The motorsports gene, 911 and the tides, as well as Freedom to the power of 911 again. The German Art Directors Club also announced two awards for the 9:11 Magazine. Innovative podcasts Porsche made a logical addition to its digital communications in the year under review, with the launch of its new podcast format 9:11 at the end of August. In this show, the sports car manufacturer provides a monthly update on interesting topics from the world of business, society and sports. In the opening episode, Oliver Blume (Chairman of the Executive Board) spoke to journalist and entrepreneur Kai Diekmann about the coronavirus and its impact. Subsequent episodes discussed topics such as the mythology of the Le Mans race, design and e-racing. An English version of the podcast made its debut in November. Detlev von Platen (Executive Board Member for Sales and Marketing) kicked off the first episode chatting with tennis superstar and entrepreneur Maria Sharapova about successful brands. Porsche Communications had already introduced two other podcasts previously: since July 2019, the company has been providing insights from the worlds first purely electric racing series with the Formula E podcast Inside E. And in April 2020 it launched Next Visions, a podcast that explores the futuristic visions of inspiring personalities from within Porsches own ranks as well as from the wider world. Porsche Communications is well established for the future, both internally and externally. A cross- media ecosystem of mutually complementary digital channels and printed media makes a major contribution in this regard. Instilling confidence in Porsches people Porsches internal communications also adapted quickly and professionally to the challenges of the new normal from the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Especially in times of crisis, it is vital to keep providing employees with up-to-date and clear information. At Porsche, internal communication comes first. Any events, developments and decisions that are relevant for the company are, where possible, communicated to the workforce before the general public. This builds confidence. A central role in this communication is played by the internal Carrera media. Whether in digital formats on the intranet or in printed publications, the Carrera formats foster an identity and ensure the utmost transparency. For example, Carrera Online gave employees early warning that Porsche would have to pause production because of the pandemic. Workers were then kept up to date on subsequent developments by a live ticker that scrolled across the intranet pages. The ticker was viewed 88,600 times. The digital information offering has been enhanced by a special Carrera app for smart phones, featuring push notifications. This app provided fast, easy-to-access information about news that affected the company, in particular on the impact of the coronavirus crisis on Porsche and its workers. In addition, a chatbot was provided to answer frequently asked questions on the topic. Carrera media: A functional eco system The Chairman of the Executive Board personally provided information to the workforce: Oliver Blume addressed employees directly in numerous video messages broadcast via Carrera Online. He spoke about the Executive Boards key decisions and latest developments in response to the coronavirus crisis. Up to four multimedia articles a day are published by the Carrera Online editorial team. These keep the companys employees, as well as staff at the subsidiaries, fully up to date. The latest news, video articles from Carrera TV and a range of other services complete the offering. Carrera TV produces up to three new video packages each week. In addition, the Executive Board make video presentations when circumstances require. Extra AR content and audio features can be accessed via the Carrera mobile app. During the year under review, there were seven editions of the four-page Carrera site newspaper, with 5,800 printed copies. This provided employees in Zuffenhausen, Weissach and Leipzig with specific local information. An eight-page special edition was dedicated to the coronavirus pandemic. The Carrera Magazine has a print run of 35,000 copies stretching over 60 pages in each issue, published four times a year. Each issue is dedicated to a specific topic. While the first quarters edition in 2020 was still an automotive-focused issue around the topic Turbo, by the time August had come around the magazine was concentrating on the coronavirus and its impact on the company. Other areas of interest included the Weissach Development Centre and the new Porsche Strategy 2030. The Carrera publications regularly win awards. The panel behind the German Brand Award 2020 recognised the Carrera Magazine with a silver medal for its Digitalisation issue. Prize-winning publications Other Porsche media projects also won plaudits during the year under review. The Porsche Annual and Sustainability Report 2019, the Porsche Art Book and the Porsche 911 Design Book were all awarded a German Design Award. The Annual and Sustainability Report 2019 also won the Red Dot Awards Best of the Best top prize. In addition, the League of American Communications Professionals (LACP) listed the publication at number 4 in its Top 100 Reports worldwide. The International Creative Media Award (ICMA) silver medal in the Annual Report Print category also went to the Annual and Sustainability Report 2019. The Roads to Taycan book was honoured with the Best of Best award in the Corporate Publishing category. This lavishly designed photobook accompanied the commercial release of Porsches first entirely electric sports car. Todays Porsche Communications division is well established for the future, both internally and externally. A cross-media ecosystem of mutually complementary digital channels and printed media makes a major contribution in this regard. This diverse range of publications has proven its worth during the coronavirus crisis. It will now be further expanded. Captivating stories beautifully told combine with highly informative content to successfully convey the companys authentic voice to the world at large, thus cementing Porsches reputation for the long term.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Driving cutting-edge technology to the limit through innovation: a speciality that Porsche is passionate about. The company offers the sportiest vehicles in their respective segments and sets important benchmarks in other areas too  from alternative drives to digitally assisted production processes. Some current examples from the reporting year help to illustrate this. Electric motors based on know-how from Weissach Porsches strategy has three pillars: dynamic electric drives, efficient plug-in hybrids and emotive combustion engines. Despite all the differences, each of these pillars has one thing in common, the Porsche sporting tradition, which allows our customers to fulfil their dreams regardless of the powertrain. The all-electric Porsche Taycan is setting standards in innovation. The Taycan has already won 50 international awards, predominantly in its main markets of Germany, China, the US and the UK. To take one example, the AutomotiveINNOVATIONS Report produced by the Center of Automotive Management (CAM) named the electric sports car the most significant innovator on the global automotive market in July 2020 with a total of 27 different innovations to its name. The scientists at CAM classed 13 of these innovations as world firsts, including the 800-volt architecture, the two-speed transmission on the rear axle, the high recuperation power of up to 265 kW and the best cW value in the segment (from 0.22). Porsches technology laboratory is motorsport  including for its series-production vehicles. Insights from LMP1 hybrid systems, for example, provide a strong foundation on which to develop the brands electric vehicles. The Porsche 919 Hybrid won the 24 Hours of Le Mans three times from 2015 to 2017. It already uses the 800-volt technology that was subsequently brought to series production in the form of the Taycan. This voltage level offers several advantages: it creates a drive with a high continuous power output and reduces the charging time. Reduced cable cross-sections also reduce the weight of the car. The Porsche E-Performance Powertrain from the Porsche 99X racing car that competed in the ABB FIA Formula E Championship also built on experience gained in LMP1. Porsche has a tradition of constantly breaking new ground in drive train development. Its electric motors are no different. In-house developments optimise the performance of the brands electrically powered sports cars and improve their efficiency. The permanently excited synchronous motors of the Taycan are highly efficient due to a range of individual measures. For example, the magnetic fields have been optimised. Each motor is also fitted with a cooling water jacket around the stator. This immovable part of the electric motor, in turn, is not wrapped in insulated copper wire with a standard, round cross-section. In the Taycan, the wire has a rectangular cross-section, which is why the coils can be extremely close together. This technology is called hairpin: the wires are bent and their shape  before they are inserted into the stators laminated core  is reminiscent of that of hairpins. The open ends are welded together using a laser beam. The result is a compact and comparatively lightweight electric motor with improved heat dissipation and optimised efficiency. This gives a higher range and guarantees permanently high performance. ELECTROMOBILITY IS A COMPLETELY INSPIRING AND CONVINCING TECHNOLOGY. BUT IN ISOLATION, IT IS MOVING US FORWARD IN SUSTAINABILITY TERMS LESS QUICKLY THAN WE WOULD LIKE. THATS WHY WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO EFUELS, INCLUDING IN RELATION TO ITS POTENTIAL APPLICATION IN MOTORSPORT. Michael Steiner, Member of the Executive Board  Research and Development Hybrid models with new battery and greater range The batteries for electric drives are constantly being developed. The recently unveiled Cayenne and Panamera models with hybrid drive have also benefited from the advances being made. The gross capacity of the liquidcooled lithium-ion battery is now 17.9 kWh compared with the previous 14.1 kWh. As a result, the purely electric range has been increased by up to 30 per cent. The new Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid can now run for up to 50 kilometres, while the Cayenne E-Hybrid reaches up to 48 kilometres (WLTP EAER City in both cases). The electric motor is integrated into the Tiptronic S eight-gear automatic gearbox in the plug-in hybrid models of the Cayenne and into the eight-speed dual-clutch transmission (PDK) in the Panamera. With 100 kW (136 hp) and 400 Newton metres of torque, the Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid can reach a purely electric top speed of 140 km/h. The combustion engine takes over when the power demand increases or when switching to the driving modes Sport or Sport Plus. In addition, the full recuperation power is available at all times. This means that the E-Charge mode is now more efficient than before. In the Sport and Sport Plus performance modes, the battery is always charged to a minimum level to provide sufficient boost for dynamic driving. This is now achieved even more effectively with a higher, reproducible charging power. With a total of 515 kW (700 hp) and 870 Newton metres of torque, the Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid is the most powerful model in the range. These figures are based on the combination of a four-litre V8 biturbo engine with 420 kW (571 hp) and the electric engine with 100 kW (136 hp). The result is exceptional driving performance: in combination with the standard Sport Chrono Package, the Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid manages the sprint from zero to 100 km/h in 3.2 seconds  0.2 seconds quicker than its predecessor, and puts in a top speed of 315 km/h  an increase of 5 km/h. eFuels for combustion engines From 2025, Porsche will be selling half of all its vehicles with e-drives  both fully and partially electric. Porsche vehicles typically tend to be driven for a very long time. Around 70 per cent of all Porsche cars ever built still exist. This is one of the reasons why the company announced in 2020 that it was to get involved in the process of researching and industrialising synthetic fuels. Since such fuels are produced with the help of electrical energy from renewable sources, they are referred to as eFuels. Porsche is targeting the development of eFuels that comply with current fuel standards. These can therefore be used in all combustion engines  in current models as well as in the brands classics and in motorsport. A major advantage compared with hydrogen, for example, is that eFuels can be distributed via the existing filling station network. The key argument for eFuels: they can help reduce the amount of CO2 emitted from fossil fuels that enters the earths atmosphere. For eFuels, normal water (H2O) is first split into the gases hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) by means of electrolysis. In the next step, the hydrogen is converted into methanol (CH3OH) in a methanol synthesis process using carbon dioxide (CO2) extracted from the air. The eMethanol produced in this way can be used in many industrial processes as a green substitute for conventional methanol, which is normally extracted from crude oil or natural gas. The process route envisaged by Porsche will convert the eMethanol into petrol using the methanol-to-gasoline (MtG) process and then refine the fuel into a standard-compliant petrol. The efficient and ecological production of the electricity needed for the electrolysis is crucial for the overall environmental balance of eFuels. Ideally, it should be generated in regions of the world with good climate conditions for green power generation. Wind turbines in South America, for example, can generate approximately four times more energy than equivalent installations in Germany. Against this backdrop, Porsche is developing and implementing a pilot project in Chile together with Siemens Energy and a number of international companies. The aim is to create the worlds first integrated and commercial large-scale plant for the production of eFuels. Ideally, methanol synthesis should take place directly on site, as transporting electricity across continents always involves very high losses. The resulting methanol or the fuel obtained from it can, however, be transported by ocean-going tankers to European refineries at comparatively low cost, with the refineries then producing the finished fuel. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. 3D printing The development of innovative vehicle technologies repeatedly results in the creation of new production methods. Various vehicle components, such as for small or special series for example, could be produced using 3D printers in future. The experts working at the Weissach Development Centre firmly believe that this will be the case, and have good arguments to back up their conviction. These include pistons produced using the 3D metal printer for the high-performance engine in the 911 GT2 RS. The highlight of the pilot project: the pistons have been designed with an integrated cooling channel, which cannot be produced using conventional methods. This channel reduces the temperature load on the pistons. Another advantage: compared with series-production forged pistons, the weight is reduced by at least ten per cent. This increases engine speed and thus the power by up to 22 kW (30 hp). The pistons from the 3D printer can also withstand the highest demands. They survived a test programme over a simulated 24 hours on a highspeed track at 250 km/h without suffering any damage. This corresponds to a distance of 6,000 kilometres. They were also subjected to 135 hours under full load as well as 25 hours of towing load at a range of speeds. Porsche has been implementing this project together with its partners Mahle, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss. The prototype of the complete alloy housing of an e-drive has also been produced using 3D printing. It weighs less than a conventionally cast component and reduces the total weight of the drive by around ten per cent. Special structures, which are only possible thanks to 3D printing, also double the rigidity in heavily loaded areas. Another advantage of additive manufacturing: numerous functions and components can be integrated. This significantly reduces the assembly effort and brings direct advantages in terms of part quality. 3D printing is currently a particularly attractive option for special and small series as well as for motorsport  from both an economic and a technical perspective. Since May 2020, Porsche has also been offering a bodyform full bucket seat individually produced by 3D printing for the 911 and 718 models. Porsche Classic has plastic, steel and alloy parts reproduced using additive processes, thus closing delivery gaps affecting its classic cars. The pistons from the 3D printer can also withstand the highest demands. They survived a test programme over a simulated 24 hours on a high-speed track at 250 km/h without suffering any damage. Patents as the basis of innovation Patents form the basis for the long-term and safe use of innovative developments. However, patent law is in a state of flux: in the past, Porsches main focus was on classic automotive technology  from chassis development to the combustion engine. Now, topics such as e-mobility, connectivity, autonomous driving and digitalisation are becoming increasingly important. Patents of relevance to todays vehicle components are therefore no longer held exclusively by traditional car manufacturers, but also by companies from the fields of electronics and mobile communications. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are also growing ever more significant. The Porsche Property rights and licences department in Weissach has adapted accordingly and, among other measures, has added experts in AI to its ranks. The department carries out the foundational work for modern patent protection: in itself, software  a central component of todays vehicles  is not classed as an invention and therefore cannot be protected by patent. This changes when fundamental concepts of a technical application are controlled by a new computer program. In other words, if software makes a technical contribution to solving a problem, it may be protected under patent law. For example: Porsche has applied for a comprehensive patent for the calibration of control units with the help of AI. Sensors record the data of the device to be controlled  such as parameters for the shifting processes of a PDK transmission or for knocking noises in the engine  and transfer these to algorithms for evaluation. The AI process now independently searches for the optimal control unit setting by making adjustments to the transmission tuning or the ignition timing. It records when a gear change has become smoother or a combustion process has taken place without knocking, for example, and stores the corresponding setting value for optimisation of the processes. Where developers previously had to rely on a laborious trial-anderror method, this technology achieves the optimal value independently and more quickly with the help of AI-enhanced learning. The method can also be applied in other technical fields. For patent lawyers, the concept of technicity is key. Because the technicity required under German and European patent law is applicable in this case, this type of method can be protected in a similar way to classic inventions in automotive engineering. Technologies Made in Weissach The Weissach Development Centre is the beating heart of innovation at Porsche. It is the companys think tank. From the initial sketch to the finished prototype, vehicles have been developed, tested and prepared for series production here since 1971 with short paths between the individual specialist areas. Design, model construction and first prototypes, testing of aerodynamics, acoustics and electronics, development of drive systems, steering systems and chassis, safety tests and trials, its own test track as well as Porsches motorsport department  EZW brings together all of these elements. The sports car manufacturer relies on traditional craftsmanship as well as state-of-the-art technology. Just under 6,800 people are employed at the site, around 80 per cent of whom work in development. These employees are shaping change for Porsche, combining the brands traditional genes with the technologies of tomorrow, and creating new inspirational and emotive products time and time again. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. SALES, PRODUCTION AND PROCUREMENT Sales Production Procurement SALES Sports car enthusiasts the world over dream of owning a Porsche. It is the job of the Sales department to make that dream reality. This is done by making the products and services that are quintessentially Porsche irresistible to customers and by creating unique experiences around the Porsche brand. In 2020, the coronavirus pandemic brought many challenges for Porsche Sales. In February, most of the dealer organisation in China closed down for around three weeks. While the situation there gradually eased from March onwards, the infection rate in Europe and other world regions only increased. Porsche Centres in many markets were closed for about six weeks. In the USA, too, around half of Porsches locations had to close temporarily at the peak of the lockdown in the spring. The crisis forced the expansion of tie-in online sales activities. Porsche had already put procedures in place for this before 2020. Virtual purchase consultations via live video, contactless test drives and digital marketing campaigns on social media channels have shaped the customer experience in a positive sense  despite social distancing. Porsche extended its new car warranty worldwide by three months if the warranty period ended between 1 March and 31 May 2020 in response to the restrictions on the operation of many Porsche Centres. Customers who purchased a Porsche Approved warranty after the new car warranty also benefited. High customer satisfaction At Porsche, people are at the centre of the company. Inspiring customers and offering secure jobs is what drives the company forward. The Sales department also works on this basis, collaborating on an equal footing with its partners in the trade. Every new sports car that Porsche delivers worldwide is an expression of this approach. Numerous trade magazines and independent studies  including in the USA, Great Britain and Germany  confirm Porsches very high level of customer satisfaction, thereby proving the success of the customer satisfaction programmes used by the company. AS A RESULT OF DIGITALISATION, CUMSTOMERS ARE INCREASINGLY USED TO AN ECOSYSTEM OF CONNECTED OFFERS. IT IS ALSO UP TO US TO COME UP WITH AN EXCLUSIVE MOBILITY EXPERIENCE FROM ONE SINGLE SOURCE. THATS WHY WE ARE CONSISTENTLY EXPANDING OUR NEW MOBILITY OFFERS, FOR EXAMPLE. Detlev von Platen, Member of the Executive Board  Sales and Marketing Recognition and awards The well-known US automotive advice magazine Kelley Blue Book awarded the sports car brand its Best Resale Value  Luxury Brand prize in 2020. Meanwhile, the Macan, Panamera and Cayenne models received the award for best resale value in their respective categories. The Taycan won two categories at the World Car Awards. It was named World Performance Car of the Year 2020 and World Luxury Car of the Year 2020. In the Automotive Performance, Execution and Layout Study (APEAL) conducted by renowned US market research company J.D. Power, Porsche was ranked in first place in the overall rating and in the luxury segment. The APEAL study looks at the attractiveness of vehicles on the US market. For this purpose, a survey of new car customers is conducted once a year. On this basis, Porsche was found to be the most attractive automotive brand to customers in the USA. Porsche also achieved first place as the best brand in the Sales Satisfaction Index (SSI) for the USA. This index is also compiled by J.D. Power and reflects satisfaction levels among new car buyers during the purchasing process. Buyers of new cars and those customers who subsequently make no purchase are surveyed on their experiences with the authorised dealers. 911 GT3 RS Porsche was also ranked in first place in the category of Best Luxury Brand by the current affairs magazine U.S. News & World Report. The rating of vehicles and brands was based on study data and the opinions of experts from the automotive industry. The US motorsport magazine Autocar voted the fully electric Taycan the best premium e-car and the Game Changer 2020. Porsche was also ranked in first place for the 911 in the Top 10 Best Sports Cars category, while the Porsche 911 GT3 secured the top position in the Top 10 Best Hardcore Sports Cars 2020 ranking. In the Top 10 Best Grand Tourers 2020 category, the Panamera left the competition in its wake. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. In Germany, more than 100,000 readers of the trade magazine auto, motor und sport voted the 911 into first place in two categories in the Best Cars 2020 ranking: as in the previous year, the 911 came in first in the Sports Cars category. In the Cabriolets category, the 911 Cabrio or 911 Targa triumphed. As far as the Golden Classic award as voted for by readers of the classic car magazine Motor Klassik was concerned, two models shared the title Classic of the Future: in the Electric cars category, the Taycan was voted number one, while the 911 Cabrio took the honours in the Cabrios category. The Taycan was also a big winner at the Golden Steering Wheel awards organised by Bild am Sonntag and Auto Bild. It was voted Best Sports Car 2020 by the editorial team and the 14-member judging panel. The readers also awarded it the title of Most Beautiful Car of the Year. The jury of the German Car of the Year award named the Taycan as the German Car of the Year 2020. The British magazine Top Gear awarded the Taycan two titles: Car of the Year 2020 and Game Changer of the Year 2020. The British magazine Top Gear awarded the Taycan two titles: Car of the Year 2020 and Game Changer of the Year 2020. The judging panel for the Chinese Car of the Year named the Taycan as the Green Car of the Year. Porsche also secured the title of Performance Car of the Year in China with the 911, and it cleaned up at the Sport Auto Awards too. Readers voted vehicles from the sports car manufacturer the winner in a total of seven categories. The Taycan Turbo S did especially well: in the category of saloons over 100,000 euros, it beat the competition hands down, regardless of engine type. In the auto motor und sport readers poll, the new 911 Turbo received the Autonis Award for the best design innovation of 2020. Another award went to the Porsche Taycan. It won the Car Connectivity Award in the readers poll in the category Connected E Cars. Readers of the German magazine Auto Zeitung voted the 911 the winner of the Auto Trophy, while Connect magazine awarded the Porsche Taycan its innovation prize. The Taycan was also named the most innovative model of 2020 by the Center of Automotive Management (CAM), an independent, scientific institute for empirical automotive and mobility research. In total, the Porsche Taycan won prestigious awards in 17 different countries. For the 17th time, Auto Bild and Schwacke chose their Value champions. All models sold in Germany were compared in 13 vehicle segments to find the passenger car with the most stable value in each class. Overall, Porsche scored two class wins: in addition to the 911 Carrera S in the sports car category, the Panamera 4 came out on top in the luxury class. Worldwide sales network Porsche Sales is constantly responding to changing developments and trends by flexibly adapting its retail landscape. The aim is always to ensure a seamless customer journey between the digital world and physical retail. The Porsche Centres are important cornerstones in this regard. Many customers view their personal interaction with dealership staff as a core Porsche competence. Surveys show time and again that what Porsche customers want more than ever is to be able to experience the brand with all their senses. At the same time, contact with other members of the Porsche community plays an outstanding role. The new retail concept Destination Porsche strengthens this community mentality. In this vein, the company opened its first pilot of a converted dealership in Hangzhou (China) in May 2020. The first completely new building opened in Dortmund (Germany) in December. Over the course of the next decade, the dealership concept will be rolled out as a central meeting point for the Porsche community at 850 existing Porsche Centres around the world. Digital offerings complement the physical dealerships. The online sales channel launched in Germany in October 2019 focuses on new and used vehicles with immediate availability. Here, customers and dealers are experiencing online vehicle sales for the first time. Particularly at the height of the lockdown, the online sales channel more than proved its worth, also thanks to additional marketing activities. Demand increased, especially in spring 2020  among both the existing customer base and a very large number of new customers. This also reflects the high level of trust in the brand. Between the beginning of April and the beginning of May 2020, around 370 orders across all price categories were placed via the German online sales channel. The number of hits on Porsches own website increased by around 50 per cent per month in the reporting year compared with 2019 levels. Since summer 2020, the online sales channel has also been available to customers in Spain, Portugal and Switzerland. Italy and France followed in November, as did Poland, Slovenia and Estonia. Starting in autumn 2020, customers in China and the USA have also been able to buy Porsche products online. In order to connect its activities even further, Porsche will be expanding its digital vehicle sales to create a comprehensive marketplace for Porsche products and services. Surveys show time and again that what Porsche customers want more than ever is to be able to experience the brand with all their senses. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. Retail concepts of the future New retail formats complement classic sales. Be where I am is the increasingly common demand from customers nowadays. In response to these changing customer requests, Porsche is implementing innovative sales formats in city centres. These include the Porsche Studios, which are primarily located in bustling city centre locations, such as shopping centres. The studios focus on delivering a special product and brand experience, but also a high-quality visit. In Hsinchu, the Silicon Valley of Taiwan, the company opened its twelfth Porsche Studio in October 2020. Pop-up venues are another example of the new approach to sales. These are a temporary sales format that can be flexibly tailored to the market conditions on the ground. From May until the end of the year, the first Porsche NOW pop-up store in Germany was located in Sindelfingen near Stuttgart together with a local dealer. Porsche NOW Tokyo followed in Japan in July. The sales pop-ups are hosted by specially trained experts who are on hand to provide advice and drum up enthusiasm for the brand. The target group is people who are not necessarily familiar with the automotive sector and Porsche products, but who are drawn to other aspects of the brand  such as design, technology and sustainability. PORSCHE STUDIO IN HSINCHU (TAIWAN) The specialist teams in Event Marketing have also developed creative event platforms, such as SCOPES driven by Porsche. Artists, musicians and fashion experts organise two-week cultural events in major cities, as has already happened in Amsterdam (Netherlands) and Tokyo (Japan). This format brings people who previously had no contact with the brand into the world of Porsche. Plans to continue with this approach in 2020 had to be put on hold as a result of coronavirus. ARTIST'S IMPRESSION OF PORSCHE EXPERIENCE CENTRE FRANCIACORTA (ITALY) Porsche Experience Centre The Porsche Experience Centres (PEC) are also places where the brand community can meet up and experience the brand for themselves. Construction work is at an advanced stage on the eighth PEC, which is being built in Italy  around 75 kilometres east of Milan  at the Autodromo di Franciacorta on a site covering around 60 hectares and incorporating the fully renovated 2,619-metre race track. The opening is scheduled for 2021. Forming the centrepiece will be a brand new building with huge expanses of glass and the Agora - a 2,400 square metre multi-purpose area with spectacular, cantilevered architecture. The facility also includes an off-road track where customers can take driving courses with varying degrees of difficulty. An area of 30,000 square metres has been earmarked for safety and car handling courses, including a kick plate track, a circuit and a handling track with a low grip surface. A simulation lab will offer virtual reality driving experiences with all of the classic and new Porsche models on the most famous racing tracks in the world. Customers will also be able to take delivery of their new Porsche at the PEC Franciacorta. At the end of 2020 the company announced its plans for the ninth Porsche Experience Centre. It will be built in the Japanese prefecture of Chiba near Tokyo. The PEC Tokyo will feature a racing circuit, a driving dynamics area, an off-road track and other driving experiences. The design for the 2.1-kilometre circuit is based on famous bends from race tracks around the world, such as the Nurburgrings Carousel and the Corkscrew at Laguna Seca in the USA. While other PECs have flat tracks, the Tokyo PEC circuit will have elevation changes due to the natural topography of the local area, making it that little bit different. Mobility of the future Porsche is responding to new mobility requirements with innovative concepts. These are based, for example, on changes in vehicle use as well as urbanisation and sustainability. It is already the case that more than half of the worlds population live in cities. The reason for this is the economic might of cities. Experts expect this development to continue. In parallel, the transport infrastructure is increasingly being exhausted, parking spaces are in short supply and congestion and air pollution are on the rise. The portfolio of mobility providers is therefore changing. Advancing digitalisation also shows how much different areas of life can be connected up to one another. This has an impact on mobility, which will focus less on individual products in future and, instead, be the result of a networked and overarching ecosystem. The boundaries between hardware, software and services are becoming increasingly blurred. More and more customers appreciate being able to book mobility at the touch of a button. With generational change in our society comes a change in peoples values. The growing importance of intangibles is just one example. For many people, having time to enjoy their lives and the ability to make their own plans are more important than owning consumer goods. Status symbols are still important but traditional preferences are evolving. In order to create innovative mobility offers, Porsche is intensively engaging with this type of trend. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. SCOPES DRIVEN BY PORSCHE Expansion of mobility services Porsche is continuously expanding its flexible mobility services in response to changing customer wishes and the trend towards digital and individual choice. In order to improve the recognisability of its global mobility services even further, the sports car manufacturer has bundled these under the new umbrella brand Porsche Drive. The premium car rental service Porsche Drive  Rental allows customers to rent current Porsche cars for anything from a few hours to up to 28 days. If required, the vehicle can also be delivered and collected. The 911, 718 Boxster, 718 Cayman, Panamera, Macan and Cayenne model series are currently available for hire from 28 locations in Germany, France, Canada, Russia, Switzerland and the USA. At some locations in Germany, France, Canada and Switzerland, the all-electric Taycan sports car is already available, offering elegant and flexible access to electric mobility. Other countries and locations are due to follow. In terms of German locations, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Cologne, Leipzig, Munich Olympiapark and Saarbrucken were added as Porsche Drive Rental locations in 2020. The highly flexible vehicle subscription service in North America is now known as Porsche Drive  Multi-Vehicle Subscription. The service is currently available in five cities in the USA and Canada: Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego and Toronto. Using an app, customers can change their vehicle as required with a choice of up to 20 different models. The sports car can be delivered to any location within the contractual territory and is personally handed over by a concierge. The monthly fee includes all running costs with the exception of fuel. In order to improve the recognisability of its global mobility services even further, the sports car manufacturer has bundled these under the new umbrella brand Porsche Drive. USING THE PARKEN PLUS APP In the US, Porsche also offers its Porsche Drive Single-Vehicle Subscription service: users opt for a specific Porsche model and take out a monthly subscription to the new vehicle. In Germany, the programme is called Porsche Drive Abo. Nearly new Porsche Approved cars from various model series are available. In the case of both programmes, the monthly fee depends on the model, but also includes all running costs with the exception of fuel. Parking made simple Porsche is also working on innovative parking services in many countries. The first such service was Parken Plus, which launched in Germany in 2017. A new app that simplifies many of the processes was introduced in 2020. The Porsche ID Card gives customers contactless access to around 300 car parks throughout Germany. They no longer need to take a paper ticket or to pay at the machine  the parking process starts and ends automatically. All customers need to do in most of the participating car parks is briefly hold up their Porsche ID Card when entering the car park. In addition to the car park service, the Parken Plus app also offers advantages when using on-street parking: users can buy a parking ticket via their smartphone and keep track of how much time is left on that ticket, a service currently available in 250 German cities. They also receive a 15-minute warning that the ticket is about to expire. The parking time can then easily be extended while on the move, again using the Parken Plus app. A further advantage is that the app only charges for the parking time that was actually used via the start-stop function. This makes parking less stressful and more cost-effective for app users, regardless of manufacturer. In 70 cities, users can also access free short-term parking tickets, which are perfect for a quick trip like popping to the bakers for example. At the end of 2020, the USA joined Germany in having this type of parking service. The Parking Plus service allows users to reserve parking spaces at more than 4,000 locations in more than 35 states across the USA in advance via the Porsche Parking Plus app. Detailed illustrated parking information is available for each parking option. Users can tailor their search for a parking space according to their specific needs, thanks to different search options. The app even provides modelspecific car park recommendations for the individual Porsche model series. These recommendations are based on feedback from other Parking Plus users. After making a reservation, users simply need to scan or present their digital parking ticket on site using contactless technology. Digital pre-booking and paying in advance means they can drive to their destination without the worry of having to find somewhere to park. If there are any delays en route, however, the reserved time can be extended at many locations. As in Germany, this service is not tied to one manufacturer. Charging infrastructure for Porsche sports cars Porsche offers its customers an optimal solution for charging their hybrid or fully electric sports cars at locations that are important to them. The Porsche Charging Service gives Taycan customers access to a high-performance charging network with more than 135,000 AC and DC charging points in 20 European countries and additional charging options in China, the USA and Canada. This network includes fast-charging stations from the partner networks IONITY and Electrify America, as well as a fast-charging infrastructure with Porsche Turbo Charging stations with 800-volt technology at many dealers in 54 markets. Porsche Destination Charging now provides around 2,000 AC charging points in more than 20 countries, for example at hotels, golf courses and marinas. In Leipzig, Porsche opened Europes most efficient charging park in February 2020. This is powered entirely by electricity from renewable energy sources. The company offers various solutions for home garages too, such as the Porsche Mobile Charger Connect with a charging power of up to 11 kW (or 9.6 kW in the case of the USA). The Porsche Charging Dock for mounting on a wall or on an existing pillar and the Porsche Compact Charging Pillar for free-standing installation are also available on request. The Home Energy Manager (HEM) is another optional feature. This smart control centre, which must be fitted by an electrician, is connected to the houses mains network to ensure smooth and convenient charging at home. The Home Energy Manager optimises the charging process from the perspective of power, time and cost. It also offers protection against overloading the houses mains network (blackout protection) by reducing the vehicles charging power as needed in the event of an impending overload, thus preventing the home distribution board from tripping. Together with an external partner, Porsche also offers related services: the Porsche Charging Pre-Check (online) and the Porsche Home Check for checking and planning the situation in the house, all the way through to the installation and commissioning of the charging technology. FAST-CHARGING PARK AT THE CUSTOMER CENTRE OF PORSCHE LEIPZIG The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. Brand cooperation projects expanded A strong brand is the essential foundation for Porsches continued success. In fact, experts believe that the importance of brand will only increase in future. It is therefore essential to constantly develop the Porsche brand in order to remain relevant and desirable in the future. This also includes placing the brand in areas where Porsche has not been sufficiently represented so far. The brand values are the guiding principles: Porsche is synonymous with a combination of pioneering spirit and tradition, but also with performance and sustainability. Also relevant to the Porsche brand are its combination of exclusivity and social acceptance, and of design and function. In order to familiarise Porsches 35,000 employees with these brand values and the brand mission statement, a web-based application has been available since 2020: the Digital Brand Academy. The application uses game-play and augmented reality to explain what the Porsche brand stands for. Users also have the chance to get hands-on, by taking a virtual ride in the Porsche Taycan for example. 3D scenes, videos and interactive elements are interwoven to create a start-to-finish experience, creating a completely new form of brand training. The Digital Brand Academy was recognised with two Red Dot Awards last year. Experts believe that the importance of the Porsche brand will only increase in future. It is therefore essential to constantly develop it in order to remain relevant and desirable in the future. Aime Leon Dore Porsche 911 Carrera 4 Teddy Santis, founder and creative director of the on-trend New York fashion label Aime Leon Dore (ALD), has restored a 911 Carrera 4 (type 964) in collaboration with Porsche. The one-of-a-kind vehicle was created after months of design work, for which Santis made research visits to places such as the Porsche Museum and the 911 production in Stuttgart, to find inspiration. The car was unveiled during the ALD fashion show at New York Fashion Week in early February 2020 and was subsequently put on display at the Jeffrey Deitch Gallery in New York until 9 February 2020. The focal point of the cars restoration is a fully customised interior featuring Schott sunflower leather and Loro Piana houndstooth fabric. Aime Leon Dore used the same materials in the design houses 2020 autumn-winter collection. Daniel Arsham Crystal Eroded Porsche 911 In collaboration with Porsche, New York artist Daniel Arsham has transformed a 911 Carrera 4S (992) into a fully functional, driving work of art. As an artist, Arsham is synonymous with multidisciplinary projects, combining art, architecture and performance. In his work, he always asks himself what an iconic product might look like in 1,000 years time, placing his faith in the growth of something timeless, like precious stones, rather than in decay. Porsche presented the Art Car to customers and fans at various events in Asia in 2020. The one-off piece was put on show for the first time in the Porsche Studio Seoul (South Korea) before being exhibited in China, including at the Chengdu Motor Show as well as in Shanghai and Beijing. Two pop-up galleries in Japan were also used to display the work of art. Porsche 911 stars in Hollywood blockbuster Bad Boys For Life Bad Boys For Life, the third film in the globally successful action series, premiered in Hollywood in January 2020. In the film, detective Mike Lowrey, played by Will Smith, drives a Porsche 911 Carrera 4S as he pursues criminals in Miami. The film also stars Martin Lawrence. Hollywood legend Jerry Bruckheimer produced the 124-minute blockbuster, released by Sony Pictures Entertainment. The official film premiere took place on 15 January on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, and involved the two stars arriving on the red carpet in a Porsche 911 Cabrio. To the cheers of watching fans, Will Smith parked the vehicle next to the original car from Bad Boys (1995), the Porsche 964 Turbo 3.6. The film has grossed 426.5 million US dollars, making the third instalment the most successful film of the series by far. Taycan Turbo S in Gran Turismo Sport The Taycan Turbo S has featured in the Gran Turismo Sport game since 2020. This is the result of Porsches extended collaboration with the Japanese video game development studio Polyphony Digital Inc., which is a subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment. The 917 Living Legend design study and the Vision Gran Turismo are currently in the works. Gamers have been able to drive Porsche vehicles in Gran Turismo Sport since as far back as 2017. Vehicle design and chronograph Porsche Heritage Design A highly contemporary 911 with quotes from the 1950s and early 1960s: as the first in a total of four collectors items from the Heritage Design strategy, Porsche has presented its 911 Targa 4S Heritage Design Edition. Historical design elements in the exterior and interior have been reinterpreted and combined with state-of-the-art technology in an exclusive special model from the Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur. In keeping with the internal model series number, only 992 units will be made. To tie in with the introduction of the special model, selected interior elements are available for all current 911 models as part of a Heritage Design package. Porsche Design is designing matching timepieces exclusively for owners of the Heritage Design vehicles. The first of these was the 911 Targa 4S Heritage Design Edition Chronograph. This timepiece combines classic design features, materials and performance characteristics of the 911 Targa 4S Heritage Design Edition, extending the concept of the sports car to the owners wrist. The automatic chronograph is powered by the Porsche Design maximum-precision WERK 01.100 with COSC certification. The watch has the titanium case typical of Porsche Design and, just like the car, is limited to 992 pieces. Two-tone leather interiors In collaboration with the designers from the Development Centre in Weissach, the Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur has designed a new interior look for the Porsche 911. The concept was unveiled in April 2020. The twotone leather interior is available in Bordeaux Red/Chalk, Black/Slate Grey, Slate Grey/ Island Green and Graphite Blue/Mojave Beige. The many decorative seams are finished in the respective contrasting colour, as is the cross stitching on the steering wheel, creating an innovative, unified concept. Other fine details include the Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur embossing on the lid of the storage compartment in the centre console, the embossed Porsche crest on the headrests and the Race Tex seatbelt outlet panels on the coupes. Personalised Porsche chronograph Since 2020, Porsche Design has been offering customers customised chronograph designs, initially offering this option in Germany, the UK and the USA. In this way the company is transferring the successful concept of the Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur from the street to the wrist. The materials and colours of the wristwatch as well as the types of leather and the yarn used in the decorative stitching of these custom-built timepieces have their roots in vehicle production. Customers can create a highly personalised chronograph, both visually and technically: the colour of the (titanium) case and dial, the material and colour of the bracelet, and the design and colour of the rotor of the automatic mechanism are all freely selectable. There are about 1.5 million possible different combinations  no other watch brand or car manufacturer can currently offer as many. The timepieces are made in the companys own watch factory in Switzerland. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. Further measures to inspire customers Watching the production of your own Porsche Porsche customers can now ramp up the anticipation as they wait to take delivery of their purchase: the new Behind the Scenes feature of the My Porsche online platform offers an exclusive look into the production operations of the sports car manufacturer in Zuffenhausen. They can follow the construction of a Porsche step by step. For the twodoor 911 and 718 sports cars, Porsche has already installed cameras at two relevant stations and connected them to the production software. Further camera locations will follow. My Porsche is the central customer portal for vehicle owners. It bundles all of the offers and services related to the individual vehicle. Porsche Track Your Dream Customers in the USA can even follow their vehicles journey from production in Zuffenhausen to delivery on the other side of the Atlantic. Porsche Track Your Dream is the name of the service developed by Porsche Digital Inc. for this market. It is also integrated into the My Porsche online platform. It is currently available for individually ordered 911s, with plans to extend it to the Taycan too. Customers can follow the Porsche sports cars as they pass through 14 milestones, including the creation of the order, the last opportunity for vehicle changes, intermediate production statuses, the start of shipping, arrival in the USA and finally at the Porsche dealer. Background information is available for every step, and a clock counts down the miles and days. VIA BEHIND THE SCENES CUSTOMERS CAN FOLLOW THE PROCESS OF BUILDING A PORSCHE New functions forROADS by Porsche The free ROADS by Porsche app, developed by Porsche itself, brings together a global community of passionate drivers to discover and share the most beautiful driving routes in the world. Additional functions have been available since August 2020. Users can, for example, now access detailed information about the air quality on their route. ROADS uses a simple traffic light system to display the current pollution level on the route being driven. Drivers can then decide whether or not to drive with open windows. They can also use the best stopping points from an air quality perspective. In addition, the app offers its users the option of organising group trips. In this way, passionate drivers can find like-minded people via the app. Existing groups can gain new members. ROADS by Porsche was launched in 2019 and now has more than 100,000 community members from over 60 different countries. The Taycan VR Experience Thanks to virtual reality, the Porsche Taycan can be experienced digitally in the showrooms of the Porsche Centres. With the Taycan VR Experience application, customers can discover the electric sports car for themselves car inside and out using a virtual reality headset. What they see is very close to the real thing. By wearing the headset, users can trace the outlines of the new model and thus experience its typical Porsche design language. A superimposed airflow simulates the aerodynamics of the Taycan. The exterior paintwork can be individually selected. The Taycan VR Experience is a fun and revolutionary development in virtual reality applications for the retail sector. The next stage will be virtual vehicle configuration, something that Porsches marketing team is working on tirelessly and which is due to be rolled out soon in the Porsche Centres.

Virtual trade fair stand in Beijing The coronavirus crisis forced Porsche to adapt its approach to trade fairs last year. At the Beijing International Automobile Exhibition in September, the biggest automobile fair in the Peoples Republic of China, the company had a digital presence in addition to its physical stand. The highlight of the trade fair was the world premiere of the new Panamera. The digital technology used to create the trade fair stand originates in the computer gaming industry and supports effortless, intuitive access. Chinese users felt equally at home with it as Porsche fans from across the world. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. PRODUCTION 2020 was an exceptional year in many respects. Total production was 263,236 vehicles, which corresponds to a decrease of 4.1 per cent compared with the previous year. At the Zuffenhausen site, the production of all vehicles was completely carbon-neutral for the first time. All vehicles of the 911 (28,672 units), 718 Boxster (12,569 units) and 718 Cayman (6,376 units) model series rolled off the production line at the main plant. 3,710 units of the 718 Cayman were also produced at the Volkswagen plant in Osnabruck. In the first full year of production, 29,450 units of the Taycan were manufactured  976 of which were assembled at the Leipzig Porsche plant as part of a temporary measure to provide the workforce with training in the context of BEV readiness. Total production in Leipzig was 101,298 vehicles, with 78,490 units of the Macan model series and 21,832 Panamera being built in Saxony. At the Volkswagen Groups multi-brand site in Bratislava (Slovakia), 82,137 units of the Cayenne model series were produced. Infection protection made by Porsche Production also played a very important role in company-wide infection protection: In July, Porsche Werkzeugbau started producing its own protective face masks for all Porsche locations, with Porsche Logistik GmbH taking care of distribution. The facility in Schwarzenberg can produce up to 80,000 masks a day. Only materials from Germany are used. A distribution centre was set up in the central parts warehouse of Porsche AG in Sachsenheim. From here, the masks and other protective equipment, such as disinfectant, are distributed to the sites. Porsches central construction, environmental and energy management department ensured that the process was closed loop: used worn masks must not be disposed of in general waste; a waste disposal concept has been developed and implemented for all sites. Crisis management and the restart The central challenge in the reporting year was the global coronavirus crisis. Porsche suspended production for an initial period of two weeks on 21 March. This was the companys response to bottlenecks in global supply chains such that normal production operations were no longer possible. Ultimately, production had to be halted at both plants for a total of six weeks. On 4 May, the sports car manufacturer launched its orderly restart with specific plans for each trade and each site. Specific protective measures were introduced in advance to guarantee the utmost safety for the workforce and to return to the assembly line step by step. Production volume Vehicles At the Zuffenhausen site, the production of all vehicles was completely carbon-neutral for the first time. 274,463* 268,691 250 200 150 100 50 0 The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. Sales, Production and Procurement Production in Zuffenhausen At the main plant in Zuffenhausen, an average of around 400 vehicles rolled off the production line every day  more than ever before thanks to the Taycan. A sophisticated control and production principle allows the assembly of all two-door sports cars  the 911, 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman  on one production line. Highly individual customer wishes are integrated directly into series production thanks to the flexible production system. Put simply, no two vehicles are exactly the same. This also applies to the Taycan, which is produced in its own factory within the factory  and without a classic assembly line. THANKS TO THE FLEXI-LINE, WE ARE THE FIRST CAR MANUFACTURER TO USE DRIVERLESS TRANSPORT SYSTEMS IN CONTINUOUS FLOW IN SERIES PRODUCTION. SO PORSCHE IS WAVING GOODBYE TO THE TRADITIONAL ASSEMBLY LINE. Albrecht Reimold, Member of the Executive Board  Production and Logistics First full year of production for the Taycan 2020 marked the first full year of production for the first all-electric Porsche, which has been manufactured at the companys main site since 9 September 2019. After the world premiere last year, it was clear, however, that this electric sports car would exceed customer expectations. The number of units produced by the end of the reporting year totalled 29,450. Economics Minister visits main plant In July, Baden-Wurttembergs Minister of Economic Affairs, Dr Nicole Hoffmeister-Kraut, visited the Taycan production plant in a Covid-safe tour. Together with Production Director Albrecht Reimold, the Minister visited the Taycan assembly line and discussed the future-proof redevelopment of the site in Zuffenhausen with its long tradition of automotive production. The talks also focused on sustainability aspects, which will feature even more strongly in future vehicle production. Dr. Nicole Hoffmeister-Kraut was impressed by the modern and innovative production methods on show. She also praised the strategy of anchoring sustainability as an essential pillar of corporate management, with carbon-neutral production of the first entirely electric sports car. Production in Leipzig Around 550 vehicles from the Macan and Panamera model series were produced on a daily basis at the Porsche plant in Leipzig. Meanwhile, the site is also shaping up for e-mobility. The decision to produce the next generation of the Macan as an all-electric variant in Leipzig means that Porsche is investing around 600 million euros in its site in Saxony. With this latest plant expansion, the company is creating the possibility of producing fully electric vehicles on the existing production line alongside petrol and hybrid models in future. Leipzig plant receives VDA Logistics Award 2020 In February, the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) presented Porsche Leipzig GmbH with the VDA Logistics Award 2020. The Saxony plant had impressed the expert panel with its logistics concept that relies on smart planning, highly automated processes, and energy-efficient warehousing and order-picking technology. With its high level of flexibility and scalability, it also takes account of the challenges inherent in the automotive industry. Porsches logistics concept for supplying the Leipzig plant provides great impetus for the logistics of the future: highly integrated, intelligently automated, trimmed for maximum reliability and efficiency. It demonstrates innovation potential for the Leipzig plant, the automotive industry and also logistics in other sectors, enthused Prof. Dr Wolfgang Stolzle, Chairman of the VDA Logistics Award judging panel and Managing Director of the Institute for Supply Chain Management at the University of St Gallen. The concept is based on a planning tool that optimises incoming delivery flows and makes best possible use of the available storage capacities. In this way, it forms the basis for an automated small-parts warehouse with energy-efficient shuttle technology, a patent- pending dynamic order picking system and several driverless transport vehicles. The new concept is also setting standards in conservation: with a total saving of 3,500 tonnes of CO2 per year, it makes an important contribution to Porsches sustainability strategy. The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. Porsche opens Europes most powerful fastcharge park In spring, Porsche launched a new charging park by the name of Porsche Turbo Charging at its production site in Saxony. A total of twelve 350 kW (DC) fast charging points and four 22 kW (AC) charging points are available at the plants customer centre  around the clock, seven days a week, and for customers of all automotive brands. The total capacity of the charging park with its six internal fast charging points is 7 MW. At the time, Porsche Leipzig thus boasted Europes most powerful fast-charging park, powered entirely by electricity from renewable energy sources. Local politicians visit Leipzig plant Tour replaces topping-out ceremony: Covid-19 meant that the official topping-out ceremony for the new bodyshop in Leipzig had to be cancelled. Instead, Leipzigs Mayor Burkhard Jung was able to visit the site for himself and be shown the latest developments: all construction measures are on schedule and the external structure has been completed for the new bodyshop for the next generation of the Macan, which will be fully electric. The next step will be the plant construction inside the building, taking up a total area of 75,500 square metres. During his visit the Mayor commented: Porsche in Leipzig has grown from an assembly plant to a technology leader for the entire European automotive sector. We are setting the benchmark for the drive technologies of the future here in Leipzig. In September, Michael Kretschmer, Minister President of the Free State of Saxony, also visited the site to see how the fifth plant expansion was progressing. In Leipzig, Porsche has set the course for the mobility of tomorrow, he said. In addition to digitalisation, climate-friendly engines are particularly important. In Saxony, we are very well positioned in the field of e-mobility and have the opportunity to continue to grow and to be at the forefront of development. Saxony will consistently support the transition to climate-friendly mobility. Porsche Leipzig shapes up for e-mobility Porsche is investing a total of more than 600 million euros in its production plant in Saxony, setting an important course for the future. The annual plant shutdown in the summer of 2020 was used to expand the assembly line. Specifically, the sports car manufacturer is now able to produce cars with three different types of drive technology on one line in Leipzig: petrol, hybrid and pure electric vehicles. For Porsche, this means maximum flexibility in production. With a view to the BEV readiness of the Leipzig Porsche plant, 1,000 Taycan vehicles were also assembled there as part of a temporary measure to provide the workforce with training. In this way, the company is already preparing itself as well as it possibly can for the next generation of the Macan. Porsche celebrated ten years of hybrid production in October 2020. This milestone demonstrates how well the concept of e-mobility is embedded in Leipzig. PRODUCTION IN LEIPZIG: A PANAMERA IN THE BODYSHOP Ten years of hybrid production Porsche celebrated ten years of hybrid production in October. This milestone demonstrates how well the concept of e-mobility is embedded in Leipzig: It was in 2010 that Porsches first hybrid vehicle, a Cayenne S Hybrid, rolled off the production line in Saxony. Porsche thus became a trailblazer in the introduction of innovative technologies and at the same time opened a new chapter in the history of the Leipzig plant. Porsche is fully committed to e-performance. To date, the Leipzig plant has produced more than 75,000 hybrid Cayenne and Panamera vehicles (2010 to 2017). By integrating hybrid vehicles into the existing production line, the Leipzig site demonstrated maximum flexibility, explained Albrecht Reimold, Member of the Executive Board for Production and Logistics at Porsche AG. We are progressing consistently along the path of integration. By expanding the plant again, we are making it possible to manufacture petrol, hybrid and pure electric vehicles on one single line in the future. We are thus preparing our site in the best possible way for the mobility and customer requirements of the future. PRODUCTION IN LEIPZIG: ASSEMBLY LINE The figures for fuel consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions are found on pages 212  213. PROCUREMENT The coronavirus pandemic had a significant impact on Porsches supply chains in 2020. Production stoppages at its suppliers presented the sports car manufacturer with extraordinary challenges in terms of procuring parts. Traditionally, procurement plays an important role in the company, with external partners accounting for around 80 per cent of Porsches value creation. Most of these are included in the group of series suppliers, comprising more than 1,300 partners. Around half of Porsches suppliers are based abroad. More than a third of these operations had to temporarily shut down their production during the first wave of the pandemic. The Procurement department reacted quickly to the first signs of coronavirus spreading across the world in January, setting up an interdisciplinary task force to deal with the global pandemic. The goal was to provide the best possible support to suppliers  particularly in countries hit hardest by coronavirus, namely China, Spain and Italy. Digital media During the first wave of the pandemic, up to 100 staff members worked together in daily telephone conferences to coordinate their actions across departments and the Group as a whole. In addition to procurement staff, employees working in requirements and capacity management, plant scheduling and logistics, and finance all attended these meetings, exchanging information with suppliers on an ongoing basis. In this way, Porsche maintained a daily overview of the parts supply pipelines and the situation with regard to its most critical partners. During this phase, the company made greater use of virtual conferences and digital media to help process and exchange comprehensive information. Shoulder to shoulder through the crisis Porsche halted its vehicle production on 21 March 2021 in response to the disruption affecting its supply chains. Some partners had been ordered by the authorities to close down their production, particularly in Italy and Spain. Intensive communication between buyers and suppliers played an important part in the subsequent ramp-up of Porsche production. On 3 May, the Italian government lifted restrictions. Just one day later, Porsche was again being supplied with important components. Combination indicators, axle components and brake callipers made in Italy arrived at the Zuffenhausen and Leipzig plants. Consequently, on 4 May, the sports car manufacturer was able to restart production. During the pandemic, Porsche supported the supply chains through a range of measures: We don't abandon our partners in a crisis, stressed Uwe-Karsten Stadter, Executive Board Member responsible for procurement. The company shared its own protocols for Covid-safe workplaces with its suppliers. Porsche employees also worked on site with partners to tighten up their processes. The company also helped out financially, offering some suppliers extended payment terms. In addition, development costs and tools were paid for earlier than contractually agreed. Porsche took over one supplier: the company serva transport system GmbH, based in Rosenheim, Germany. This supplier of driverless transport systems had run into financial difficulties due to the crisis. Social commitment Porsche fulfilled its commitment to society in many areas during the coronavirus crisis. In particular, the Procurement team contributed its comprehensive supply chain expertise. Porsche organised the delivery of PPE from China for the federal states of Baden- Wurttemberg and Saxony free of charge, working in collaboration with DB Schenker and Lufthansa Cargo. Up to six cargo planes per week were flying from China to Germany between March and May. The total value of the deliveries coordinated by Porsche was in the hundreds of millions of euros. LINKING OUR CONTRACT AWARD PROCESS TO SUSTAINABILITY CRITERIA SENDS OUT A STRONG SIGNAL. Uwe-Karsten Stadter, Member of the Executive Board  Procurement S-rating gets a positive verdict Sustainability as a strategic corporate goal plays a central role in procurement. This is reflected in the Code of Conduct applicable to all direct Porsche suppliers. This sets out the principles for legally compliant, sustainable and responsible business conduct in relation to compliance, social affairs and the environment. Since July 2019, sustainability has been a binding criterion when awarding contracts to any Porsche supplier of production materials. This is guaranteed via the S-rating, with S standing for sustainability. Suppliers must comply with the requirements of the S-rating in order to continue working with Porsche. The sports car manufacturer supports its partners and advises them on the implementation of appropriate sustainability measures. By 2020, more than 90 per cent of suppliers had already met the sustainability requirements for production materials. Linking our contract award process to sustainability criteria sends out a strong signal, commented Uwe-Karsten Stadter. Identification of sustainability risks using AI and blockchain For the purposes of procurement, sustainability has to be considered in its entirety. This is why Porsche is also committed to transparency in the supply chains of its subcontractors and raw material suppliers. To date, this has required a great deal of research and documentation. Over 3,000 parts are used in every Porsche vehicle produced. The supply chains comprise many small parts and are globally networked. Some sub-supply chains comprise up to eight upstream stages. Against this background, Porsche began testing new technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) in supply chain analysis during the reporting year. These digital solutions are designed to identify sustainability risks more quickly and efficiently. For example, AI software used by Porsche to screen local media helps to identify potential violations of sustainability principles at an early stage. In addition, a blockchain pilot application was developed together with suppliers BASF and Motherson. The algorithm can be used to identify the origin of greenhouse gas emissions in supply chains. On the basis of smart contracts, which are made available to the companies involved in the process, the CO2 emissions generated by individual components are passed on digitally along the entire supply chain. This enables the CO2 footprint of a product to be quantified in a standardised way. Porsche began testing new technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) in supply chain analysis during the reporting year. These digital solutions are designed to identify sustainability risks more quickly and efficiently. Sustainable raw material extraction Porsche took another step towards sustainable supply chain management by joining the cross-industry Responsible Mica Initiative (RMI). This cross-industry association of international companies and non-governmental organisations, founded in 2017, is committed to transparency and improved working conditions in relation to the mining of mica. Mica is used as a raw material in many industrial and cosmetic products, and at Porsche is used in paints. Porsche represents the Volkswagen Group in the RMI. Through internal analysis of selected paint supply chains up to raw material extraction, Porsche has identified potential risks for sustainability in relation to the mining of mica. Together with its suppliers, the company is committed to transparent and sustainable handling of the raw material. The aim of the projects, based in the major Indian mining regions of Jharkand and Bihar, is to improve the living and working conditions of the local people  particularly by means of fair working conditions, occupational safety and minimum wages. International scouting with innovative suppliers The transformation of the automotive industry is in full swing. Procurement is actively helping to shape this process, identifying new and innovative companies for Porsche to work with. Through international supplier scouting, the innovation management team at Porsche works with embassies and consulates to contact prospective partners. For the second time, Porsche carried out a scouting campaign in neighbouring France. A total of 89 French companies  including numerous start-ups  took part in a virtual pitch in October that had been organised in cooperation with the French consulate in Dusseldorf. The participants came from a variety of fields, including e-mobility, battery technology, production 4.0 and 3D design. Both sides benefited from the event, with around half of the companies being invited to further talks. Following scouting sessions with the consulates of France, Canada, Israel, Finland and Taiwan, this format is to be expanded further over the coming years.

FINANCIAL POSITION Cash flows from operating activities amounted to  4,140 million in the 2020 reporting period following  4,486 million in the prior year. The material effects resulted from the higher profit before tax, lower income tax payments as well as higher depreciation, amortization and write-downs and, on the other hand, higher outflows from other provisions, financial services receivables and in inventories. The cash flows from investing activities resulted in a cash outflow of  3,019 million in the reporting period following  3,617 million in the prior year. Investments in intangible assets (excluding capitalized development costs) and property, plant and equipment decreased from  2,044 million in the prior year to  1,547 million in the current reporting period. Additions to capitalized development costs amounted to  1,225 million following  949 million in fiscal year 2019. Cash inflows form the change in loans and time deposits amounted to  51 million (prior year: cash outflows of  427 million), with investments in securities resulting in cash outflows of  300 million (prior year:  146 million). Cash flows from financing activities saw a positive change to  78 million in the current fiscal year after negative  353 million in the prior year. Payments made in respect of profit transfer and dividends resulted in a cash outflow of  1,802 million (prior year:  2,294 million). By contrast, capital contributions made by Porsche Holding Stuttgart resulted in a cash inflow of  1,028 million (prior year:  1,273 million). The net available liquidity of the automotive division  i.e., its gross liquidity less financial liabilities and excluding the financial services division in each case  improved from  1,785 million as of December 31, 2019 to  2,961 million as of December 31, 2020. Porsche AG Group sales rose to 28,695 million euros in the reporting period, from 28,518 million euros in the previous year. Sales revenue of the Porsche AG Group in  million 28,518 28,695 25 20 15 10 5 0 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Porsche AG group's profit after tax increased by  365 million from  2,801 million in the corresponding prior-year period to  3,166 million in the current fiscal year. The tax rate in the reporting period was 28 per cent (prior year: 31 per cent). Consolidated revenue in the Porsche AG group amounted to  28,695 million in the reporting period (prior year:  28,518 million). The Porsche AG group sold 264,989 new vehicles in the past fiscal year. This corresponds to a 4 per cent decrease in unit sales compared with the prior year. The Cayenne is the bestselling series with 88,261 vehicles sold, followed by the Macan with 77,575 vehicles, which was the series hit the hardest by the drop in sales with 19,189 fewer vehicles sold. The Taycan was mostly able to compensate for the drop in sales with 22,221 vehicles sold coupled with the 3,631 increase in sales of the 718 series. In regional terms, China is still the largest market and, with vehicles sold totalling 87,730 units, remained at the prioryear level. The European and German markets witnessed a particularly strong decline in the fiscal year. In Europe, sales decreased by 10 per cent to 55,085 vehicles. Sales in Germany fell the most in relative terms, by 16 per cent, to 23,321 vehicles sold. Cost of sales increased slightly to  21,598 million (prior year:  21,256 million), which unchanged on the prior year represents 75 per cent of sales revenue (prior year: 75 per cent). In absolute terms, cost of sales rose by  342 million or 2 per cent. The increase in cost of sales with a simultaneous decrease in unit sales is primarily due to changes in the product and region mix as well as expenses related to factory construction and personnel growth for the Taycan series. The capitalization ratio for research and development costs amounted to 55 per cent (prior year: 44 per cent). The gross margin remains constant at 25 per cent (prior year: 25 per cent). Following the decline in sales as well as the decrease in marketing events as a result of the coronavirus crisis, distribution expenses fell from  2,044 million to  1,881 million. Administrative expenses rose from  1,029 million to  1,095 million. In proportion to sales revenue, distribution expenses remained unchanged at 7 per cent (prior year: 7 per cent), while administrative expenses increased to 4 per cent (prior year: 3 per cent) primarily due to higher costs in the area of digitalization. Personnel expenses across all functions of the Porsche AG group increased from  4,003 million to  4,230 million. The increase in personnel expenses is mainly driven by the rise in the average number of employees during the year by 2,009 to 36,019. Depreciation, amortization and write-downs across the various functions increased to  3,357 million compared with  3,044 million in the prior year. The increase mainly relates to the depreciation of rightof- use assets, capitalized development costs and property, plant and equipment. Other operating income rose from  846 million to  953 million. The increase is largely due to the  85 million rise in income from instruments used in currency hedges as part of hedge accounting. Other operating income decreased from  1,173 million to  897 million. In the prior year, this item had contained special items for the diesel issue, specifically a  535 million fine imposed in the administrative offense proceedings instigated by the public prosecutor's office in Stuttgart. Adjusted for these special items, other operating expenses mainly increased due to the  135 million rise in expenses from foreign exchange gains.

The financial result amounted to  220 million (prior year:  192 million). In the reporting year, writedowns of  115 million (prior year:  83 million) were recognized on the investment in Bertrandt AG accounted for using the equity method. This was counterbalanced by higher income from the measurement of financial instruments. Profit before tax amounted to  4,397 million (prior year:  4,054 million after special items,  4,589 million before special items). The healthy cost structure and the sustainably high earnings power of the Porsche AG group are also reflected in the key performance indicators. Despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus crisis, the Porsche AG group generated an operating return on sales of 14.6 per cent (prior year: 13.5 per cent before special items, 15.4 per cent after special items) in the past fiscal year, mainly due to countermeasures and cost discipline being introduced as an early stage as well as an excellent market performance in the second half of the year. The pre-tax return on sales amounted to 15.3 per cent (prior year: 14.2 per cent after special items, 16.1 per cent before special items). The return on capital, defined as the ratio of the operating result after tax to the average invested assets of the automotive division, amounted to 18.1 per cent (prior year: 18.5 per cent after special items, 21.2 per cent before special items). The return on equity after tax was 16.8 per cent (prior year: 16.5 per cent). The coronavirus crisis Operating profit (EBIT) of the Porsche AG Group in  million has had a major impact on economic activity around the world. Nevertheless, operating income amounted to 4,177 million euros. This compares with 4,397 million euros (before special items) in the previous year, or 3,862 million euros after special items. 5 4,397* 4,289 4 3 2 1 0 *before special items: 4,397 after special items: 3,862 Financial Data Consolidated Income Statement Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity Value added statement Consolidated Income Statement of Dr. Ing. h.c.

The year for which the parental leave is recorded is the year in which the period of leave begins. 2) Due to the relatively long duration of parental leave or as a result of leave commencing late in the respective reporting year, not all employees have returned by the time of data collection. The return to work and retention rate cannot be calculated on an annual basis as employees who returned in a given year did not necessarily also begin their parental leave in that same calendar year.

The COVID-19 pandemic turned our lives upside down. It continues to pose considerable challenges for the society, the economy, our patients and especially for health care systems worldwide. As a leading health care provider for renal patients, we look after one of the most vulnerable populations. We see it as our responsibility to ensure their safety and well-being. Since the start of the pandemic, we have worked tirelessly and taken extensive measures. This includes more stringent safety and hygiene rules at our more than 4,000 dialysis centers, so that our 346,553 patients worldwide can continue to have their life-saving dialysis treatment. We benefited from our vertical integration. When an unprecedented number of patients requested home dialysis, and public policies all over the world supported them, we had the infrastructure in place to deliver: a suite of best-in-class home products, a supply chain we could scale up quickly, tens of thousands of employees that rallied around home therapies, and thousands of training rooms where nurses, dietitians, and social workers could educate patients. The same was true when we rapidly expanded our digital and telehealth options to allow physicians to consult patients remotely. RICE POWELL Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Management Board T O O U R S H A R E H O L D E R S Letter to our shareholders Management Board Capital markets and shares FRE SENIUS MEDIC AL C ARE 2 0 2 0 INNOVaTIONS a R e paYIN g OFF The pandemic has shown how important innovation, agility and flexibility are for companies. At Fresenius Medical Care, we are now benefiting from the work we put in prior to the pandemic. One example is our expanded home care portfolio. Home dialysis means even less contact, and hence the potential for a lower infection risk. In 2020, we provided more than 14 percent of our dialysis treatments in the U.S. in a home setting. This implies a 14 percent increase compared to the previous year. Digital solutions like the health platform TheHub in the U.S. allow patients to transmit their latest treatment data to us, access lab results, retrieve information about their medicine, send messages to their care team, and reorder products. We were able to increase the number of Transitional Care Units (TCUs), a special area we have established at our clinics in the U.S., where trained staff informs new patients about the various methods of dialysis and help them to find the right treatment. Nearly half of them subsequently opt for home dialysis. Severe COVID-19 cases often cause acute kidney failure, which has significantly increased worldwide demand for acute dialysis products. We expanded our production of acute dialysis products at short notice to respond. In 2020, the FDA cleared Novalung, a heart and lung support system for the treatment of acute respiratory or cardiopulmonary failure. This so-called ECMO system (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) maintains the patients blood circulation and oxygenates their blood, reducing the stress on damaged heart and lungs. We also increased our production of Novalung consoles to treat the growing number of critically ill COVID-19 patients. FOC US ON paTI e NT C a R e measures go toward protecting our patients who are exposed to high mortality resulting from the virus, and to keeping dialysis patients out of hospital. This also helps hospitals to preserve already limited resources and capacity. All this costs money. In 2020, the U.S. government initiated financial support for the health care sector under the so-called CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act). It was intended to compensate the increased costs health care providers had to spend as a result of the pandemic and for related protective measures. This enabled us to offset some of our additional costs in the U.S. in the year 2020. W e a CHI e V e D OUR g O a LS Despite all the challenges of the pandemic, we achieved our goals. We generated revenue of 17.86 billion euros in 2020. In constant currency, that is five percent more than in 2019. Net income excluding special items rose by twelve percent in constant currency. Our shareholders share in our success: In line with our dividend policy, we propose a rise in our dividend of twelve percent to 1.34 euros to the Annual General Meeting on May 20, 2021. This would be our 24th consecutive dividend increase. C OVID- 19 CH a LL e N ge S The COVID-19 pandemic is not over yet. Since November 2020 we have seen accelerated infection rates. Many of our highly vulnerable dialysis patients did not survive. What saddens me deeply is the human tragedy  patients are dying we have cared for. With an increasing number of vaccines being approved, there seems to be a way out of the pandemic. In the U.S., we are partnering with other dialysis providers to combat the pandemic. Together we have created a nationwide contingency plan to create capacities across providers for isolated treatment in order to maintain con- tinued care for dialysis patients. In addition, we supported our U.S. direct patient care teams with childcare and eldercare stipends, as well as supplemental pay. All these Despite all the challenges of the pandemic, we achieved our goals. From a financial perspective we have been able to almost compensate the financial effects of COVID-19 in 2020. But the recent developments cannot be compensated. We expect to have a significant adverse effect on the number of patients treated and additional COVID-19 related costs. Against this backdrop, we expect revenue to grow at a low- to mid-single digit percentage rate and net income to decline at a high-teens to mid-twenties percentage rate. T O O U R S H A R E H O L D E R S Letter to our shareholders Management Board Capital markets and shares FRE SENIUS MEDIC AL C ARE 2 0 2 0 OUR g LOB a L SUS Ta IN a BILITY p R O g R a M I am very pleased that we made good progress with our sustainability agenda in 2020. Sustainability is fundamental to us, and to an ever-increasing number of investors and other stakeholders. Our Global Sustainability Program establishes common goals, responsibilities, policies, and Key Performance Indicators for material areas, and is under my direct responsibility. This is because sustainability is very important to me personally: Improving our social and ecological footprint is not just something that is nice to have. It is our responsibility. Sustainability is integral to an organizations competitive agility. It is essential to drive growth, efficiency, and innovation. Our aim is to transform our organization and culture. Thats why we have defined new, non-financial performance targets for management compensation. They reflect our aspiration to be measured by our commitment to continuous improvement. OUR WaY FOR Wa RD Improving our social and ecological footprint is not just something that is nice to have. It is our responsibility. Aspects of the renal care continuum include: New renal care models: We are working to develop new forms of renal therapy, using digital technologies such as artificial intelligence and the capability to analyze huge amounts of data. Value-based care: Drawing on our comprehensive experience in disease management, we will push forward the transition from a fee-for-service payment model to pay-for-performance models. Chronic kidney disease and transplantation: We will expand our offerings in the area of value-based care models beyond dialysis to include the treatment of chronic kidney disease, as well as playing an active role in the area of kidney transplantation. Future innovations: We will continue to advance the development of renal care innovations and invest in start-ups and early-stage companies in the health care sector. The second area is critical care solutions. Demand for critical care solutions is set to rise in the long term: By 2030, the number of patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy to treat acute kidney failure is estimated to increase to 1.6 million per year. We will continue to strengthen our critical care portfolio. The third area is complementary assets. To leverage its existing network and create an additional basis for future growth, the Company will further expand its network through partnerships, investments, and acquisitions. As part of our strategy, we announced our new medium-term outlook through 2025. Over the next five years, we expect an annual average increase in the mid-single digit percentage range for revenue and in the upper-single digit percentage range for net income. In 2020, we presented our Strategy 2025. This is our plan for our continued future success. The strategy is embedded in the Companys Global Sustainability Program. Our products and health care services are at the core of our strategy. To take it to the next level, we will concentrate on three key areas: the renal care continuum, critical care solutions, and complementary assets. To support our Strategy 2025, to further strengthen profitability, and to compensate for the negative earnings effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will launch the FME25 program. It will focus on the transformation of our operating model. Until 2025, we plan to invest up to 500 million euros in FME25 to sustainably reduce our cost base for each future year minimally by the same amount. We assume that the FME25 program compensates for the anticipated COVID-19 related effects on our 2025 outlook. T O O U R S H A R E H O L D E R S Letter to our shareholders Management Board Capital markets and shares FRE SENIUS MEDIC AL C ARE 2 0 2 0 Ta KIN g C a R e IS a T ea M e FFOR T The pandemic was, and still is, a global storm that hit us hard, from our clinics to our offices, and from our supply chains to our production sites. It is a threat to everybody we care for, to our patients in the dialysis clinics and the millions who depend on us. But amid uncertainty and fear, we did our part, and many of us did a lot more. We showed that care is not just a word in our name, but a principle that holds up under pressure. I am so proud of the way we handled this. More than 125,000 employees around the world demonstrated their exemplary commitment to ensure that our patients experienced no interruption in the supply of their products and services. With the introduction of vaccines, we now have hope. Now it is time to make sure that all our patients and frontline care teams receive their vaccination as quickly as possible. We can turn that hope into reality. Taking care is a team effort, and our partners also supported our patients in a big way. From the government officials who supported us to the Fresenius Medical Care truck drivers who ventured out when nobody else would, I have encountered outbursts of goodwill and bravery in the last months. I am confident we can take this mindset into the future. Yours Rice Powell Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Management Board We showed that >care< is not just a word in our name, but a principle that holds up under pressure.

PRICE DEVELOPMENT OF FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE SHARES The year under review began with positive news for Fresenius Medical Care: On December 31, 2019, a Californian federal court temporarily halted a controversial ballot initiative (Assembly Bill 290) that could have negative consequences for our busi- ness. The share price increase in the first weeks of 2020 was also driven by the publication of the results for fiscal year 2019 and the confirmation of the outlook for 2020. At 77.58, Fresenius Medical Care shares subsequently traded at just below what would become the high for the year. From the end of February, the worldwide spread of COVID-19 caused share prices to plummet on the global stock exchanges, in some cases dramatically. While benchmark indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the U.S. and the DAX in Ger- many lost around one-third of their value compared to the start of the year, Fresenius Medical Care shares showed a much more robust performance. The share price declined to a low for the year of 56.00 in late March, down around 18 % on the start of the year. Fresenius Medical Care underlined the resilience of its business model with excellent results in the first quarters of the year under review. Thanks to comprehensive measures taken early on to minimize the risk of infection, we were able to ensure the operation of our dialysis centers as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed. The production of dialysis products worldwide also continued without significant interruption despite the restric- tions on public life, and our supply chains remained intact. Back in March 2020, the U.S. government launched an important stimulus package for the health care sector  the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). The funds disbursed under the CARES Act, which were made available to the affected companies from April onward, served to offset additional costs incurred for protective measures against COVID-19 in the important U.S. market in the following months. Our share price began to recover in late March and reached a high for the year of 79.00 by the end of July. The severity of the course of the disease in kidney patients infected with the coronavirus led to an increase in the number of hospital stays and a rise in mortality rates among these patients. This resulted in more dialysis treatments being missed. Moreover, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many T 1.1 STOCK INDICES / SHARES Source: Bloomberg data, own calculations patients with advanced chronic kidney disease were referred to dialysis centers later than they would otherwise have been. These two factors negatively affected the organic growth of Fresenius Medical Care in fiscal year 2020. This was reflected in the revenue figures reported from the third quarter onward, i.e. with a delay of several months. The results for the third quarter were additionally impacted by negative exchange rate effects and, as expected, lower reimbursements for calcimimetics, which are used to regulate the level of calcium in the blood of dialysis patients. Thanks also to the extensive measures taken by Fresenius Medical Care in recent years to improve efficiency  unconnected with the COVID-19 pandemic  we were able to absorb the impact of the pandemic on net income in the first nine months of fiscal year 2020. As at the beginning of the year, regulatory developments in early November 2020 provided a stimulus for the Fresenius Medical Care share price. Firstly, the U.S. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers the government insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid, announced an increase in the reimbursement for dialysis treat- C 1.2 SHARE PRICE PERFORMANCE, ABSOLUTE, JANUARY 1, 2020  DECEMBER 31, 2020 IN  Jan.

Secondly, citizens in the U.S. state of California rejected Proposition 23, a ballot initia- tive that was voted on at the same time as the presidential election. If this proposition had come into force, it would have led to additional costs for Fresenius Medical Care in operating its dialysis centers in California. Fresenius Medical Care shares closed the year at 68.20, corre- sponding to an increase of 3.4 % in 2020.

A long-term comparison highlights the strength and stability of Fresenius Medical Care shares: Within the last ten years, the share price has increased by around 60 %. With dividends rein- vested, this corresponds to an appreciation of around 6 % per annum. Fresenius Medical Cares market capitalization amounted to 20.0 BN at the end of the year under review. 130 120 110 100 90 80 70 60  Fresenius Medical Care shares ()  Fresenius Medical Care-ADRs (US$)  Dow Jones Industrial Average  DAX  STOXX Europe 600 HealthCare Source: Bloomberg data, own calculations C 1.4 INDEX AND SHARE PRICE PERFORMANCE IN A TEN-YEAR COMPARISON WITH DIVIDENDS REINVESTED, INDEXED, JANUARY 1, 2011  DECEMBER 31, 2020 (DECEMBER 31, 2010 = 100) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0  Fresenius Medical Care shares ()  Fresenius Medical Care-ADRs (US$)  Dow Jones Industrial Average  DAX  STOXX Europe 600 HealthCare Source: Bloomberg data, own calculations C 1.5 DEVELOPMENT OF THE DIVIDEND IN  2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.1 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 1 Planned proposal to be approved by the Annual General Meeting on May 20, 2021. DIVIDEND AND SHARE BUYBACK At the virtual Annual General Meeting on May 20, 2021, the General Partner and the Supervisory Board plan to propose a dividend to shareholders of 1.34 per share. This would equate to an increase of 0.14, or 11.7 % compared to the previous year, and an annual increase of around 9 % since 1997 (See CHaRT 1.5). With 292.9 M shares entitled to receive dividends (as at December 31, 2020), the total dividend payout would thus amount to 392 M; the payout ratio in relation to net income for 2020 would come to around 34 %. Based on the proposed dividend and the closing share price for 2020, the dividend yield on the shares would be 2.0 % (2019: 1.8 %). Fresenius Medical Care remains committed to its ambitious goal of closely aligning the development of its dividend with growth in earnings per share, while maintaining dividend continuity. In 2020, Fresenius Medical Care again created further value added for its shareholders by buying back shares. As part of the latest share buyback program, a total of 14.6 M shares with a cumulative value of 929 M were repurchased between March and May 2019 as well as between June 2019 and April 2020. Fresenius Medical Care used the repurchased shares solely to reduce the Companys registered share capital. To this end, the purchased shares were canceled in December 2020 together with a further 1 M treasury shares held by Fresenius Medical Care at that date. SHAREHOLDER STRUCTURE In our analysis of the shareholder structure as at December 31, 2020, we matched around 92 % of the approximately 292.9 M outstanding Fresenius Medical Care shares with their owners (See TaBLe 1.6). Accordingly, our largest shareholder, Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA, continues to hold around 94.4 M shares, corre- sponding to an equity holding of 32 %. In addition, we identi- fied eleven institutional investors with at least 1 % of our capi- tal stock. According to our most recent analysis, 736 institutional inves- tors hold Fresenius Medical Care shares. The largest 20 account for approximately 51 % of the identified free float, i.e. the iden- tified shares excluding shares held by Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA (previous year: 48 %). As at December 31, 2020, 41 % of the institutional free float was held by investors from the United States. Great Britain accounted for 21 %. We were able to identify 8 % of the free float of institutional investors in Germany and a further 7 % in France (See TaBLe 1.7).

Investors consult sustainability ratings and rankings to help them assess how companies perform in this area. Since 2008, Fresenius Medical Care has participated in the ranking con- ducted by the non-profit organization CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project). In 2020, we improved to category B in the category Climate and to category B- for Water. These rank- ings place us among the leading companies in the global health care sector. In addition, Fresenius Medical Care was repre- sented in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) Europe for the eleventh time in the year under review. The index tracks those companies among the 600 largest listed ones in Europe that S&P Global, a world-leading provider of financial data and analysis, considers to be the best in economic, ecological, and social terms.

VOTING RIGHTS NOTIFICATIONS Based on the notifications received, we are aware that (in addi- tion to Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA) only BlackRock Inc., Artisan Partners Asset Management Inc., and Harris Associates L.P. held more than 3 % of the voting rights in Fresenius Medical Care at the end of 2020. All voting rights notifications in accordance with sections 33, 38, and 39 of the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG) are published on our website at www.freseniusmedicalcare.com under Investors. ANALYSTS ASSESSMENTS OF OUR SHARES Financial analysts continue to show great interest in our com- pany. In 2020, 28 equity analysts, known as sell-side analysts, reported on our company and on Fresenius Medical Care shares. At the end of the year, 19 of them issued a buy recom- mendation and nine a hold recommendation. RATING AND FINANCING Fresenius Medical Care is rated investment grade by the three leading rating agencies Standard & Poors, Moodys, and Fitch. The rating of all three agencies remained unchanged in the period under review. An overview can be found in TaBLe 2.33 ON page 53. In May 2020, Fresenius Medical Care placed bonds with a total volume of 1.25 BN, broken down into a six-year tranche (500 M) and a ten-year tranche (750 M), as part of the Debt Issuance Program (DIP). An additional bond with a volume of $1 BN was issued in September 2020 and will mature in February 2031. The bonds issued in fiscal year 2020 have allowed Fresenius Medical Care to optimize the financing costs, currency mix and maturity profile of its liabilities, thereby further strengthening its financial position. In this way, we are laying the foundations for investments in our sustainable, long-term growth. T 1.8 KEY SHARE DATA INVESTOR RELATIONS ACTIVITIES Our investor relations activities focus on ensuring equal access to continuous information and transparency for all capital mar- ket participants. This constitutes disclosing information on Fresenius Medical Cares strategy, its operational and financial business development, and its sustainability activities. Our tar- get groups comprise not only shareholders, analysts, and other capital market participants, but also employees, journalists, and the general public. Our aim is to make a significant contri- bution to growing the value of Fresenius Medical Care in the long term by means of transparent financial communication. In fiscal year 2020, the Investor Relations team informed ana- lysts and investors of the Companys development in more than 800 one-on-one discussions. In all, we showcased Fresenius Medical Care at 22 roadshows and 30 investment conferences in Europe and North America, largely in virtual form. These fig- ures show that we continued our intensive dialog with capital market participants in 2020 despite the travel restrictions that have been in place since the spring. At its first fully virtual Capital Market Day in October 2020, Fresenius Medical Care presented the next steps in its corpo- rate strategy and its financial outlook to 2025 to a total of around 170 investors and analysts.

OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP We provide high-quality health care solutions for patients with renal diseases. Our innovative products and therapies set high standards in dialysis treatment. BUSINESS MODEL Operations and company structure Fresenius Medical Care is the worlds leading provider of prod- St. Wendel (Germany), Ogden, Utah (U.S.), Changshu (China), LArbresle (France), and Buzen (Japan). Dialysis machines are manufactured in Schweinfurt (Germany) and in Concord, Cali- fornia (U.S.). Fresenius Medical Care has a decentralized structure and is divided into the regions North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Our operat- ing segments correspond to this regional breakdown (the term North America Segment refers to our North America operating segment, the term EMEA Segment refers to the Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segment, the term Asia-Pacific Segment refers to our Asia-Pacific operating segment, and the term Latin America Segment refers to our Latin America operating segment). C 2.1 OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ucts and services for individuals with renal diseases based on publicly reported revenue and the number of patients treated. We provide dialysis care and related services to people with renal diseases, as well as other health care services. The health care services that we offer in addition to dialysis are described by the term Care Coordination. Together with dialysis ser- vices, these constitute our health care services. We also develop and manufacture a full range of dialysis machines, systems and disposable products, which we sell to customers in around 150 countries as well as using them in our own health care service operations. Our dialysis business is there- fore vertically integrated. We continue to generate most of our revenue with dialysis products and dialysis care services. In our 4,092 proprietary dialysis clinics in around 50 countries worldwide, we provide care for over 346,000 dialysis patients. We are continuously expanding this network of clinics, which is the largest in the world based on the number of patients treated, to accommo- date the ever-rising number of dialysis patients. At the same time, we operate 44 production sites in more than 20 coun- tries. The most important plants for dialyzer production are in Fresenius Medical Cares company headquarters is in Bad Hom- burg v. d. Hohe, Germany. The headquarters in North America, our most important region in terms of revenue, is in Waltham, Massachusetts (U.S.). CHaRT 2.2 ON page 20 provides an overview of our most import- ant production sites and headquarters. Our products and services Fresenius Medical Care provides mainly dialysis products and services. We also offer non-dialysis services as part of Care Coordination as well as non-dialysis products. Our products and services for the fiscal year 2020 are shown in CHaRT 2.1. Approximately 3.7 M patients worldwide regularly under- went dialysis treatment at the end of 2020. Dialysis is a life-saving blood cleansing procedure that substitutes the function of the kidney in case of kidney failure.

Many diseases can lead to chronic kidney failure, particularly diabetes, chronic nephritis or high blood pres- sure. There are currently two treatment options for ESRD: a kidney transplant and dialysis. Our health care products We develop, manufacture and distribute a wide variety of health care products, including both dialysis and non-dialysis products. The dialysis products we offer in around 150 countries around the world focus on the following therapies:  Hemodialysis (HD) - HD is by far the most common type of therapy for chronic kidney failure. Fresenius Medical Care pro- vides a wide range of HD products in dialysis centers as well as for use at home. They include machines, dialyzers, blood- line systems, HD solutions and concentrates, water treatment systems, as well as data processing and analysis systems.  Peritoneal dialysis (PD) - In PD the peritoneum is used as a natural filter. We offer systems and solutions for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) in dialysis centers as well as for use at home.  Acute dialysis - In case of a sudden loss of renal function, con- tinuous renal replacement therapy is used in intensive care units. Fresenius Medical Care also provides products for this. We also offer non-dialysis products including acute cardio- pulmonary products and products for apheresis therapy, which involves the removal of excess blood fats or pathogenic anti- bodies. Our health care services Dialysis services Dialysis patients receive life-saving dialysis treatment and other associated services such as laboratory tests in our 4,092 (2019: 3,994) dialysis clinics worldwide. Dialysis treatment at our clinics is usually performed three times a week over a period of several hours by trained medical staff. We also pro- vide advice on medical support and training for home dialysis patients in our dialysis centers. In 2020, we treated most of our patients (61 %) in the North America Segment, followed by 19 % in the EMEA Segment, 11 % in the Latin America Segment and 9 % in the Asia-Pacific Segment. Fresenius Medical Care is able to operate its own dialysis clinics in countries where the health care system allows private-sector companies to provide medical services and an appropriate reimbursement system is in place. Care Coordination Care Coordination allows us to further enhance our business beyond dialysis, for example in markets where the privatized dialysis market is relatively well developed and we already have a high market share. Although our Care Coordination business is geared to different geographical markets, we currently pro- vide non-dialysis services mainly in North America and Asia- Pacific. In recent years, the health care system in the U.S. has started to move away from reimbursement of individual ser- vices toward holistic and coordinated care. Our Care Coordina- tion activities and our experience in dialysis mean that we can participate in the development of the U.S. health care system. At the same time, patients can benefit from coordinated care, and health care systems from lower costs. Major markets and competitive position According to our estimates, the number of dialysis patients worldwide reached around 3.7 M in 2020 (2019: 3.6 M) - a 3 % growth rate. In the same period, 346,553 patients were treated in Fresenius Medical Cares network of dialysis centers (2019: 345,096). This means that Fresenius Medical Care holds the leading position worldwide in dialysis care. More information on the number of patients can be found in CHaRT 2.3 ON page 22. Fresenius Medical Care is also the global market leader for dial- ysis products. Products made by Fresenius Medical Care for use in our own dialysis centers or for sale to third-party customers accounted for a market share of 35 % in 2020 (2019: 36 %). In the case of hemodialysis products, we had a 40 % share of the global market (2019: 41 %), making us the world leader in this field as well. Dialyzers for hemodialysis are the largest product group in the dialysis market with a worldwide sales volume of around 370 M units in 2020. Approximately 158 M (around 43 %) of these were made by Fresenius Medical Care, giving us by far the biggest market share. Hemodialysis machines constitute another key component of our product business. Here, too, we are the clear market leader. Of the estimated around 90,000 machines installed in 2020, approximately 42,000, or around 48 % (2019: more than 50 %), were produced by Fresenius Medical Care. Furthermore, we hold a strong position in the market for peri- toneal dialysis products: Around 16 % (2019: around 16 %) of all peritoneal dialysis patients use products made by Fresenius Medical Care. Fresenius Medical Care is also the global leader in dialysis care, providing treatment to about 9 % of all dialysis patients. The C 2.3 PATIENTS TREATED CORPORATE STRATEGY AND OBJECTIVES Creating a future worth living. For patients. Worldwide. Every day. This vision guides us in our efforts to give our patients around the world a better life by offering them high-quality products and outstanding health care. At the same time, we expect to face a multitude of challenges in the coming years: an aging population, a rise in chronic dis- eases, fragmented care, staff shortages, cost pressure, digitali- zation, and the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which require new approaches and solutions in health care.  Fresenius Medical Care  Other providers Source: Company data and estimates Renal care continuum overall market for dialysis care services in the U.S. is consoli- dated. Across all market segments, we treat around 38 % of all dialysis patients here. Outside the U.S., the dialysis services business is much more fragmented. With over 1,460 dialysis centers and approxi- mately 140,000 patients in around 50 countries, Fresenius Medical Care operates by far the largest network of clinics. Global Manufacturing, Quality and Supply Global Manufacturing, Quality and Supply (GMQS) is the opera- tions division within Fresenius Medical Care that manages the procurement, production, distribution and supply of renal and multi-organ therapy products. GMQS strives to ensure reliable product quality and effective product supply at optimized total cost with efficient utilization of capital. The objective of our production strategy is to manufacture high-quality products in the right place at the right time on the best possible terms. We are able to implement this strategy thanks to a network of large production sites, where we make products for sale worldwide, as well as smaller production sites that primarily supply products regionally. Strategic purchasing at Fresenius Medical Care is geared toward ensuring the availability, safety and quality of the mate- rials used in production with the aim of further expanding our competitive and internationally balanced supplier network. At the end of 2020, GMQS had 16,307 employees (full-time equivalents) (2019: 16,418). To meet the challenges of the future, we are leveraging our core strategic competencies: innovating products, operating outpatient facilities, standardizing medical procedures and coordinating patients effectively. Between now and 2025, we intend to go a step further and take our strategy (See CHaRT 2.4 ON page 23) to the next level to bring us closer to our goal of providing health care for chronically and critically ill patients across the renal care con- tinuum. We aim to use our innovative, high-quality products and services to offer sustainable solutions at a reliable cost. The renal care continuum encompasses the following aspects:  New renal care models: We intend to use digital technologies such as artificial intelli- gence and big data analytics to develop new care models for patients with kidney failure, including personalized dialysis and holistic home treatment. C 2.4 OUR WAY FORWARD - STRATEGY 2025 unnecessary hospital stays. We also intend to incorporate kid- ney transplants into value-based care models in the future.  Future innovations: Through our subsidiary, Fresenius Medical Care Ventures GmbH, we invest in start-ups and early-stage companies in the health care sector with the goal of gaining access to new and disruptive technologies and treatment concepts for our core business and complementary assets. Critical care solutions The number of patients requiring continuous renal replace- ment therapy to treat acute kidney failure is set to rise to 1.6 million per year by 2030. We will expand our existing acute care portfolio to include other extracorporeal critical care ther- apy areas, such as the treatment of acute heart, lung and multi-organ failure. Complementary assets 11th time as a sustainability leader with inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI Europe). For further information, see the separate Non-Financial Group Report starting on page 80 and the Compensation Report starting on page 124.  Value-based care models: Value-based care models allow us to offer care that is not only better, but also affordable in the long term. Our aim is to establish sustainable partnerships with payors around the world to drive forward the transition from fee-for-service pay- ment to pay-for-performance models.  Chronic kidney disease and transplantation: We want to provide patients with holistic care along their entire treatment path. To this end, we have extended our value-based care programs to include the treatment of chronic kidney disease with a view to slowing disease progres- sion, enabling a smoother start to dialysis, and preventing We will supplement and strengthen our existing network where feasible through additional partnerships, investments and acquisitions. This will help us to create medical value added while saving costs, enabling us to build an even more solid foundation for our future growth to 2025 and beyond. Global Sustainability Program For us, sustainability is about being successful in the long term and creating lasting value - economically, ecologically and socially. Our Global Sustainability Program will allow us to step up our efforts to integrate sustainability into our business activities over the next three years. For example, we have intro- duced sustainability as a non-financial performance target for compensation. In November 2020, we were recognized for the PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM The Management Board oversees our Company by setting stra- tegic and operational targets and measuring various financial key performance indicators used for internal management determined in euro based upon IFRS. The key performance indicators used for internal management are identical in the individual operating segments. Each operating segment is evaluated based on target figures that reflect the revenue and expenses they control. The effects of certain transactions and income taxes are not included as we believe these items to be outside the operating segments con- trol. Financing is a corporate function, which the operating seg- ments do not control. Therefore, we do not include interest expense relating to financing as an operating segment mea- surement. Similarly, we do not allocate certain costs which relate primarily to certain headquarters overhead charges, including Accounting and Finance, certain Legal costs, Global Research and Development, GMQS and costs attributable to the Global Medical Office, because we believe that these costs are also not within the control of the individual operating seg- ments. Certain of the following key performance indicators and other financial information as well as discussions and analyses set out in this report include measures that are not defined by IFRS (Non-IFRS Measure). We believe this information, along with comparable IFRS financial measurements, is useful to our investors as it provides a basis for assessing our performance, payment obligations related to performance-based compensa- tion, our compliance with financial covenants and enhanced transparency as well as comparability of our results. Non-IFRS financial measures should not be viewed or interpreted as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with IFRS. Some key performance indicators and other financial mea- sures used in this report such as changes in revenue, operating income and net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA (or net income) include the impact of translating local currencies to our reporting currency for financial report- ing purposes. We calculate these Non-IFRS financial measures at constant exchange rates in our publications to show changes in our revenue, operating income, net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA and other items without giving effect to period-to-period currency fluctuations. Under IFRS, amounts received in local (non-euro) currency are trans- lated into euro at the average exchange rate for the period pre- sented. Once we translate the local currency for the constant currency, we then calculate the change, as a percentage, of the current period calculated using the prior period exchange rates versus the prior period. This resulting percentage is a Non-IFRS Measure referring to a change as a percentage at constant currency. These currency-adjusted financial mea- sures are identifiable by the designated terms Constant Exchange Rates or Constant Currency. We believe that the measures at Constant Currency are useful to investors, lenders and other creditors because such informa- tion enables them to gauge the impact of currency fluctuations on our revenue, operating income, net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA and other items from period to period. In addition, under our long-term incentive plans, we measure the attainment of certain pre-determined financial targets for revenue growth and net income growth in Constant Currency. However, we limit our use of Constant Cur- rency period-over-period changes to a measure for the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of local currency into euro. We do not evaluate our results and performance without considering both: 1. Period-over-period changes in revenue, operating income, net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA and other items prepared in accordance with IFRS and 2. Constant Currency changes in revenue, operating income, net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA and other items. We caution the readers of this report not to consider these key measures in isolation, but to review them in conjunction with changes in revenue, operating income, net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA and other items pre- pared in accordance with IFRS. We present the growth rate derived from non-IFRS measures next to the growth rate derived from IFRS measures such as revenue, operating income, net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA and other items. As the reconciliation is inherent in the disclo- sure included within Results of operations, financial position and net assets starting on page 45, we believe that a separate reconciliation would not provide any additional benefit. Revenue growth The management of our operating segments is based on reve- nue growth as a key performance indicator. We believe that the key to continue growing our revenue is to attract new patients and increase the number of treatments performed each year. The number of treatments performed each year is therefore an indicator of continued revenue growth. For further information regarding revenue recognition and measurement, refer to NOTe 1 K of the notes to consolidated financial statements. Rev- enue growth is also benchmarked based on movement at Con- stant Exchange Rates.

Operating income is also benchmarked based on movement at Constant Exchange Rates. Operating income margin Operating income margin represents the ratio of operating income to revenue. We believe operating income margin shows the profitability of each of our operating segments or our con- solidated company. Delivered operating income (Non-IFRS Measure) As a result of the significance of noncontrolling interest holders in our operations, we believe a measure that is meaningful to investors is operating income less noncontrolling interests (Delivered Operating Income). Delivered Operating Income approximates the operating income attributable to the share- holders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA. As such, we believe that operat- ing income is the closest comparable IFRS measure. Delivered Operating Income is also benchmarked based on movement at Constant Exchange Rates. TaBLe 2.5 shows the reconciliation of operating income to Delivered Operating Income on a consolidated basis and for our reporting segments. Net income growth at Constant Currency (Non-IFRS Measure) On a consolidated level, percentage growth in net income (net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA) at Constant Currency is an additional key performance indicator used for internal management. Basic earnings per share growth at Constant Currency (Non-IFRS Measure) Percentage growth in basic earnings per share at Constant Cur- rency is a key performance indicator to evaluate our profitabil- ity. This indicator helps to manage our overall performance. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to shareholders by the weighted-average number of outstanding shares over the course of the year. Capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments We manage our investments using a detailed coordination and evaluation process. The Management Board sets our complete investment budget as well as the investment targets. Before realizing specific investment projects or acquisitions, our inter- nal Acquisition & Investment Committee examines the individ- ual projects and measures considering the expected return on investment and potential yield. Investment projects are evalu- ated using common methods such as net present value, inter- nal interest rate methods and payback periods. We utilize this evaluation methodology to ensure that we only make and implement investments and acquisitions that increase share- holder value. Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and capitalized development costs is an indicator used for internal management. It influences the capital invested for replacement and expansion. Cash flow measures Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in % of revenue Our consolidated statement of cash flows indicates how we generated and used cash and cash equivalents. In conjunction with our other primary financial statements, it provides infor- mation that helps us evaluate changes to our net assets and our financial structure (including liquidity and solvency). Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities is applied to assess whether a business can internally generate the cash required to make the necessary replacement and expansion of investments. This indicator is impacted by the profitability of our business and the development of working capital, mainly receivables. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in percent of revenue shows the percentage of our revenue that is available in terms of financial resources. It is an indicator of our operating financial strength. Free cash flow in % of revenue (Non-IFRS Measure) Free cash flow (which we define as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities after capital expenditures, before acqui- sitions and investments) refers to the cash flow we have at our disposal, including cash flows that may be restricted for other uses. This indicator shows the percentage of revenue available for acquisitions and investments, dividends to shareholders, reducing debt financing or for repurchasing shares. TaBLe 2.6 shows the cash flow key performance indicators for 2020 and 2019 and reconciles free cash flow and free cash flow in percent of revenue to net cash provided by (used in) operat- ing activities and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in percent of revenue, respectively. T 2.6 CASH FLOW MEASURES IN  M 2020 2019 Revenue 17,859 17,477 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 4,233 2,567 Capital expenditures (1,052) (1,125) Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment 16 12 Capital expenditures, net (1,036) (1,113) Free cash flow 3,197 1,454 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in % of revenue 23.7 14.7 Free cash flow in % of revenue 17.9 8.3 Net leverage ratio (Non-IFRS Measure) The net leverage ratio is a key performance indicator used for internal management. To determine the net leverage ratio, debt and lease liabilities less cash and cash equivalents (net debt) is compared to adjusted EBITDA (earnings before inter- est, taxes, depreciation and amortization) (adjusted for acquisi- tions and divestitures made during the year with a purchase price above a 50 M threshold as defined in the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement, non-cash charges and impairment loss). The ratio is an indicator of the length of time the Company needs to service the net debt out of its own resources. We believe that the net leverage ratio provides alternative information that management believes to be useful in assessing our ability to meet our payment obligations in addition to considering the absolute amount of our debt. We have a strong market position in a growing, global and mainly non-cyclical market. Further- more, most of our customers have a high credit rating as the dialysis industry is characterized by stable and sustained cash flows. We believe this enables us to work with a reasonable pro- portion of debt. TaBLe 2.7 shows the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and net leverage ratio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

(NxStage) on February 21, 2019 (2019: 95 M) (NxStage Costs), non-cash charges, primarily related to pension expense (2020: 50 M; 2019: 46 M), and impairment loss (2020: 199 M; 2019: 40 M). Return on invested capital (ROIC) (Non-IFRS Measure) ROIC is the ratio of operating income after tax (net operating profit after tax or NOPAT) to the average invested capital of the last five quarter closing dates, including adjustments for acquisitions and divestitures made during the year with a pur- chase price above a 50 M threshold as defined in the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement, and expresses how efficiently we allo- cate the capital under our control or how well we employ our capital with regard to investment projects. Additionally, we have excluded the impairment of goodwill and trade names in the Latin America Segment driven by a macro-economic down- turn and increasing risk adjustment rates for certain countries in the region (Impairment Loss) (See NOTe 2 a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements) to increase comparabil- ity of the underlying financial figures of certain Management Board compensation performance targets with the Companys operating performance and to adequately recognize the actual performance of the members of the Management Board. An adjustment to exclude amounts related to the implementation of IFRS 16, Leases, which replaced the straight-line operating lease expense for former leases under International Account- ing Standard 17, Leases, with a depreciation charge for the lease asset and an interest expense on the lease liability as well as the classification of certain IAS 17 leases (such effects being, collectively Effect from IFRS 16) is included for the purpose of increasing the comparability of previously reported informa- tion in accordance with our long-term incentive plans in 2019 (see the Compensation Report starting on page 124 for addi- tional information regarding these adjustments). TaBLeS 2.8 UNTIL 2.17 STaRTINg ON page 28 are showing the reconciliation of average invested capital to total assets, which we believe to be the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure, and how ROIC is calculated. TaBLe 2.18 ON page 33 provides an overview of our key perfor- mance indicators. Operating performance excluding special items (Non-IFRS Measure) Management believes that there are special items which should be excluded from certain metrics to enhance transparency and comparability. In the presentation of the expected development of our business in our outlook, we identified special items which, when excluded from the results disclosed, may provide a reader with further useful information in assessing our perfor- mance. These results excluding special items are presented as part of the comparison of the actual business results with the outlook and in our outlook, together with reconciliations of the key indicators for our consolidated financial statements pre- pared in accordance with IFRS to the key indicators excluding special items. These results excluding special items should only be viewed as a supplement to our results disclosed in accor- dance with IFRS. Changes to the internal management system In 2021, the internal management system will be updated due to adjustments in the remuneration of the Management Board and the way in which the Management Board will manage and represent the Company in the future. As a result, we have also adjusted the primary financial key performance indicators of the internal management system and included these metrics in our outlook for the 2021 financial year. Based on these changes, operating income margin, Delivered Operating Income (Non-IFRS Measure), basic earnings per share growth at Constant Currency (Non-IFRS Measure), capi- tal expenditures, net cash provided by (used in) operating activ- ities in % of revenue, free cash flow in % of revenue (Non-IFRS Measure) and net leverage ratio (Non-IFRS Measure) will no longer be used as financial key performance indicators for internal management from January 1, 2021.

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities and free cash flow as well as in % of revenue, capital expenditures and net leverage ratio (as described above) will continue to be included as secondary financial performance indicators, while Delivered Operating Income will no longer be reported as a financial performance indicator in future periods. As a result, we are introducing new financial key performance indicators, which will be used for internal management and reported externally alongside the previous financial key perfor- mance indicators. In addition to revenue and net income growth as defined above, management will now focus on the absolute amount of revenue and net income to manage our business. Revenue and net income are also benchmarked based on Constant Exchange Rates. For the purposes of management compensation, these metrics are also benchmarked at the underlying exchange rates used in the calculation of our incen- tive compensation targets. Primary key performance indicators for internal management from 2021 onwards are as follows:  revenue  revenue growth  operating income  net income  net income growth  ROIC These metrics, with the exception of ROIC, will be presented both in accordance with IFRS and at Constant Currency. ROIC and each of these indicators presented at Constant Currency is considered a non-IFRS measure. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Developing innovative products and continuously improving our renal therapies are intrinsic elements of our growth strat- egy. Our worldwide research and development activities, which are centrally managed by the Global Research and Develop- ment division (GRD), enable us to develop products and renal therapies efficiently and to systematically promote the exchange of knowledge and technology between regions. Global research and development strategy Health care systems face major financial challenges. We aim to direct our research and development activities toward develop- ing innovative products and renal therapies that not only meet high quality standards that improve clinical outcomes, but are also affordable. As an operator of proprietary dialysis clinics and a provider of products for treating patients at home, we believe that these aims are entirely compatible. We are also in a strong position to provide life-saving therapies and treat- ments to patients suffering from acute kidney failure due to COVID-19. Our research and development strategy contributes to our strategy 2025 which aims to provide health care for chronically and critically ill patients across the renal care continuum, in critical settings and by acquiring and developing complemen- tary assets. It is globally orientated, enabling us to respond even better to the worldwide rise in demand for high-quality yet cost-efficient treatment and therapy methods. In doing so, we also take regional market conditions into account and offer a differentiated product range across all three key areas of our strategy 2025 (see chapter Corporate strategy and objec- tives starting on page 22). In the future, we intend to deliver innovative, competitive prod- ucts even more efficiently and strengthen our focus on devel- oping countries. In addition to research and development activ- ities within our Company, we collaborate with external partners with the aim of building a comprehensive innovation and tech- nology network. These partners include numerous academic institutions, such as research institutes at prestigious universi- ties in the U.S. Another partner is the Renal Research Institute in New York. This subsidiary of Fresenius Medical Care North America is a renowned institution in the field of clinical research into all aspects of chronic kidney failure. Together, we are work- ing on fundamental issues relating to renal therapies. We are also increasingly collaborating with start-ups with the objective of promoting an open culture of innovation and enabling access to the latest technologies. Innovations in 2020 Our aim is to continuously improve our patients quality of life and the outcomes of their treatment as well as to ensure our growth in the medium to long term. To this end, we are not only working on new products that are close to market launch, but also on an extensive portfolio of innovation projects. These focus on technologies in our core business as well as related areas of strategic interest. The next generation of dialyzers In 2020, we started by introducing our next-generation hemo- dialysis and hemodiafiltration dialyzer FX CorAL in EMEA. It incorporates an innovative fiber membrane design, Helixone hydro, made using novel fiber production processes. The inner lumen of Helixone hydro fibers mimics the bloods natural environment, lowering the risk of an immunological reaction. This has the potential to result in better tolerability for our patients. We expect a full launch in 2021. Our Optiflux EnexaTM F500 with Endexo technology is a new dialyzer designed to support the treatment of patients without the need for heparin. Endexo is a surface-modifying polymer that is added to the dialyzer during manufacturing. It makes the surface of the membrane less thrombogenic, so that the blood is less likely to clot. The Optiflux EnexaTM F500 was recently given FDA 510(k) clearance and thus has passed a key hurdle prior to market launch. It is now in the last stage of development before being marketed in the U.S. New home dialysis system launched For many patients, peritoneal dialysis is the dialysis treatment modality of choice and the gentlest option during the first years of renal replacement therapy. The new SILENCIA Auto- mated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) therapy system, due to be launched in 2021, promises affordable, state-of the-art dialysis quality for peritoneal dialysis patients, especially in emerging markets. The robust, functional design of the cycler ensures a quick set-up and easy operation. It allows silent and reliable treatment at night while the patient sleeps. System for respiratory or cardiopulmonary support In February 2020, Novalung, a system that can be used for respiratory or cardiopulmonary support, received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The sys- tem is distributed in the U.S. under the name Novalung sys- tem and in other countries as Xenios Console with various treatment kits. Novalung is the first extracorporeal membrane oxygenation system approved for more than six hours of use as a life sup- porting therapy in the U.S. It provides assisted extracorporeal circulation and physiologic gas exchange, such as oxygenation and CO2 removal. Patients are often unable to absorb sufficient oxygen into their bloodstream or excrete carbon dioxide from their bodies, lead- ing to acute oxygen deficiency. The system maintains the patients blood circulation and supplies the blood outside the body with oxygen, relieving the heart and lungs. Digital health care Connectivity is a key element of our development strategy to support the expansion of home therapies. Patients who are in close contact with their clinicians are less likely to be hospital- ized. As more patients are treated at home, it is essential for us to optimize workflows for clinicians and reduce the burden for patients. To this end, Fresenius Medical Care launched its KinexusTM Therapy Management Service, a cloud-based home patient management solution, in Chile and the U.S in 2020. Its features include remote dialysis monitoring, treatment work- flow management, personalized prescription programming, and daily treatment reporting to clinicians. Kinexus TM allows us to improve patients home therapy experience and support those caring for them, with the goal of keeping them at home for longer. Optimizing therapies through analytics Modern analytical tools open up new opportunities for enhanc- ing and automating the end-to-end delivery of dialysis treat- ments. They can be used to determine the optimal treatment for individual patients and to automate the respective treat- ment sequence. Moreover, these tools make it possible to not only evaluate the vital parameters of patients but also to mon- itor and optimize the functional state of machines or related services. Fresenius Medical Care Data Solutions Care GmbH is working on these approaches and solutions with the aim of allowing physicians to focus even more on patients and the course of the disease itself. Research in the field of regenerative medicine We are investing in promising technologies and research approaches in the area of regenerative medicine through our affiliate Unicyte AG as well as our subsidiary Fresenius Medical Care Ventures GmbH. Our venture capital company is increasingly collaborating with start-ups with the aim of promoting an open culture of innova- tion and gaining access to the latest technologies. While our portfolio company, Corvidia, was acquired by a major pharma- ceutical company in 2020, during the year we invested in the following two companies:  Alucent Biomedical (Alucent) is a privately held medical technology company headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Alucent was founded by Avera Health to develop and market products using Alucent Natural Vascular Scaffolding (Alu- centNVS) technology. AlucentNVS is a first-of-its-kind com- bination drug-device therapy designed to assist the body in naturally opening and maintaining arterial patency.  Magenta Medical (Magenta) is a privately owned medical device company based in Kadima, Israel. Magenta is working on a next-generation percutaneous left ventricular assistive device and a transcatheter renal venous decongestion device. Research and development resources In fiscal year 2020, Fresenius Medical Care spent a total of around 194 M on research and development (2019: 168 M), corresponding to around 5 % (2019: 5 %) of our health care product revenue. At the end of 2020, our patent portfolio comprised some 11,223 property rights in approximately 1,626 patent families, i.e. groups of patents linked to the same invention. Our research and development work in fiscal year 2020 produced around 135 additional patent families. Our broad portfolio of patents shall provide us with a wide range of treatment options in this highly competitive field in the future. At December 31, 2020, 1,218 employees (full-time equivalents) worked for Fresenius Medical Care in research and develop- ment worldwide (December 31, 2019: 1,157). They come from various backgrounds: Physicians work side by side with soft- ware specialists, business economists and engineers in inter- disciplinary teams. More than 730 employees - the majority of our research and development staff - are based in Europe. Most research and development activities are carried out at our facilities in Schweinfurt and Bad Homburg v. d. Hohe (Ger- many). Other development sites are in St. Wendel (Germany), Bucharest (Romania) and Krems (Austria). In the U.S., the Com- pany maintains centers of excellence for the development of devices in Concord (California) and for dialyzers and other dis- posable products in Ogden (Utah). Development activities in Shanghai and Changshu (China) are focused on the growing demand for cost-effective dialysis systems in Asia and emerg- ing markets. The Global Research and Development organiza- tion coordinates collaboration and technology exchange among the various sites. Carrying out research and development responsibly is an intrinsic element of our innovative culture. More information is shown in TaBLe 2.19 ON page 36. EMPLOYEES Fresenius Medical Care owes its business success to the com- mitment of its employees.

Our workforce therefore increased by 4 % year-on-year, or by 4,705 employees in absolute terms. This was mainly due to organic business growth and acquisitions, both of which were impacted by COVID-19 related personnel requirements. TaBLe 2.20 shows the breakdown of employees by operating segment as well as by products and services. Staff costs at Fresenius Medical Care increased to 7,067 M in 2020 (2019: 6,799 M), corresponding to 40 % (2019: 39 %) of revenue. Average staff costs per employee (annual average based on full-time equivalents) amounted to 56,770 (2019: 56,740).

QUALITY MANAGEMENT At Fresenius Medical Care, we have a clear focus: we want to offer high-quality and reliable products and therapies to ensure the best possible medical care for our patients and customers. We operate production facilities worldwide to meet the demand for our dialysis products and other health care products. Quality management at our production sites Over the last several years, GMQS has introduced a stable infra- structure with efficient processes and systems. All production sites follow the Lean Manufacturing approach which, in our North America Segment and our Schweinfurt plant, includes the Lean Six Sigma management system. The focus of Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma is on the continuous improve- ment of manufacturing processes to achieve a low defect rate resulting in improved product quality, while reducing manufac- turing times. We have successfully harmonized all local Quality Management Systems (QMS) in all manufacturing and develop- ment sites of our EMEA Segment, Latin America Segment and Asia-Pacific Segment under one Consolidated QMS (CQMS). Every medical device plant within these segments has a local QMS directed by CQMS that is certified either to ISO 13485:2016 and / or ISO 9001:2015. The QMS of each site is reviewed through periodic management review, internal corporate and internal local audits. Quality management in our dialysis clinics Our clinics work in conformance with the generally accepted quality standards of the industry, particularly the U.S. Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, the European Renal Best Practice standard, and increasingly the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), an indus- try initiative for global clinical practice guidelines. Clinical data management systems are used to routinely collect certain medical parameters, which we evaluate in anonymized form in compliance with these guidelines. More information about our quality management including our quality data can be found in the Non-Financial Group Report starting on page 80. Quality-based reimbursement systems We participate in quality-based reimbursement models, which we describe in the section Health care and reimbursement systems vary from country to country in the chapter Eco- nomic Report starting on page 38. SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT Operating on a global scale means having global responsibility. Fresenius Medical Care is aware of this responsibility. Over the past years, we have continuously stepped up our sus- tainability activities. We have launched a Global Sustainability Program to further drive the integration of sustainability into our business. Acting in a responsible and sustainable manner is a fundamen- tal component of our strategy; it secures our future as a glob- ally operating company in the health care industry. Further information can be found in the separate Non-Financial Group Report starting on page 80. ECONOMIC REPORT The dialysis market is a sustainable growth market U.S. dollar, as well as partly stronger fluctuations in the received a donor organ. Further information can be found in emerging economies. Some currencies in emerging econo- TaBLe 2.21. mies in particular depreciated significantly against the euro with steadily rising demand for products and ser- vices to treat patients with chronic kidney disease. MACROECONOMIC AND SECTOR- SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT Macroeconomic environment Dependency on economic cycles Our business is exposed to economic cycles only to a relatively small extent. This sets us apart from manufacturers of con- sumer goods, for instance, whose products are subject to more cyclical demand. Our business is impacted more by government reimbursement rates and remuneration systems. Dialysis is a vital medical ser- vice, which is why it is usually paid for by the responsible health care system. Overall, the rapid global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a material deterioration of the conditions for the global economy and greatly reduced economic growth. The conditions also changed for our business in fiscal year 2020. Nonetheless, this development shows that our vertically inte- grated business model can be viewed as solid and resilient during the crisis. Exchange rate developments The global exchange rate developments in fiscal year 2020 were characterized by a strengthening of the euro against the and the U.S. dollar. As Fresenius Medical Care has a worldwide presence, the results of its operations are impacted by exchange rate developments. Movements in the U.S. dollar and the euro are especially crucial as we generate a major part of our revenues in the U.S. On average over the course of the year, the euro traded slightly stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to fiscal year 2019. In addition, Fresenius Medical Cares operating results are influenced by changes in the exchange rate between the euro and local currencies. This is partly due to intra-Group sales from large production sites in the euro zone to Group compa- nies with different functional currencies, but also because the euro is the currency we use for financial reporting. Regarding intra-Group sales, individual subsidiaries are exposed to fluc- tuations in the exchange rate between the invoicing curren- cies and the currencies in which they conduct their local oper- ations. Fresenius Medical Care reduces transaction risks, i.e. risks from foreign currency exposures or exchange rate fluc- tuations, through a global network of production facilities, which is geared toward demand in the Companys dialysis product business. As the production facilities are often based in the markets they serve, costs are incurred in the same cur- rency in which revenue is generated. The risk of exchange rate fluctuations is relatively low for health care services because they are provided locally and are therefore invoiced in the respective currency. Sector-specific environment Chronic kidney failure (end-stage renal disease, ESRD) is a global disease. The number of patients requiring renal replace- ment therapy is increasing worldwide: At the end of 2020, approximately 4.5 M patients underwent dialysis treatment or T 2.21 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC KIDNEY FAILURE 2020 Share Patients with chronic kidney failure 4,487,000 100 % Of which patients with transplants 823,000 18 % Of which dialysis patients 3,664,000 82 % In-center hemodialysis 3,228,000 72 % Peritoneal dialysis 413,000 9 % Home hemodialysis 23,000 1 % Source: Company information and estimates. For many years now, the number of donated organs worldwide has been significantly lower than the number of patients on transplant waiting lists. Despite extensive efforts by regional initiatives to increase awareness of kidney donation and the willingness to donate, the share of patients receiving kidney transplantation compared with other treatment methods has remained relatively unchanged over the past ten years. The prevalence of chronic kidney failure varies between regions. There are several reasons for this:  The countries differ demographically, as age structures in the population vary worldwide.  The prevalence of risk factors for kidney disease, such as dia- betes and high blood pressure, varies widely.  The genetic predisposition for kidney disease also differs sig- nificantly around the world.  Access to dialysis remains restricted in many countries, meaning that many patients suffering from chronic kidney failure are not treated and therefore do not appear in preva- lence statistics.  Cultural factors, such as nutrition, play a role. The number of dialysis patients rose by around 3 % in 2020. The decrease compared to our previously expected growth rate of approximately 6 % for dialysis patients in 2020 is primarily caused by COVID-19 related excess mortality of ESRD patients. Comparison of dialysis treatment methods In 2020, most dialysis patients were treated in one of more than 46,000 dialysis centers worldwide, with an average of more than 75 patients per center. However, this figure varies considerably from country to country. Hemodialysis is by far the most common form of therapy for chronic kidney failure. A total of 88 % of dialysis patients were treated in this way at a dialysis center in 2020. Home hemodi- alysis is an alternative to treatment at a dialysis center. Although take-up has been limited to date, the number of home hemodialysis patients is rising continuously. A total of 1 % of all C 2.22 IN-CENTER VS. HOME DIALYSIS 12 % (436,000) 3,664,000 DIALYSIS PATIENTS WORLDWIDE 88 % Due to the large number of different services offered in the area of Care Coordination, we cannot provide a meaningful estimate of the market volume. We currently offer medical ser- vices in Care Coordination primarily in the North America and Asia-Pacific Segments and have adapted our services in this area to these markets. The extent to which we roll out our Care Coordination services outside the U.S. may vary in individual countries and regions depending on the respective reimburse- ment system and market environment. Our customers are mostly health insurers and companies Fresenius Medical Cares most important customers are state- owned or public health insurers, private health insurers, and companies. Health care and reimbursement systems patients are currently treated in this way. In the year under review, 11 % of all dialysis patients were treated with peritoneal dialysis, usually at home. As a result, 12 % of the dialysis patients were treated with home dialysis. CHaRT 2.22 shows a comparison of in-center and home dialysis. Volume of the dialysis market IN-CENTER DIALYSIS HOME DIALYSIS Care Coordination (3,228,000) vary from country to country As renal replacement therapy is a life-saving medical service, patients often do not have to pay for dialysis themselves. Instead, the costs are borne by the responsible health care system. The reimbursement systems for dialysis treatment - in other words, the structures used by health care systems to reg- ulate reimbursement for dialysis services - differ from country to country and sometimes even within countries. The business According to our estimates, the volume of the global dialysis market increased to around 82 BN in 2020. We expect the fol- lowing approximate breakdown for this market volume: around 15 BN for dialysis products and approximately 67 BN for dial- ysis services (including dialysis drugs). Chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular dis- eases are becoming increasingly common and are responsible for approximately two out of three deaths worldwide. In many countries, a large proportion of health care spending goes toward treating chronic diseases. To counteract the resultant increase in cost pressure, more and more health care systems, such as that in our largest market, the U.S., are starting to promote coordinated, holistic care rather than reimbursing individual services. activities of dialysis service providers and the reimbursement of dialysis therapy are affected by various factors including regional conditions, the treatment method, regulatory issues, and the type of provider (public or private). Our ability to influence the reimbursement of our services is limited. The environment for reimbursement and the condi- tions for prescribing ancillary services significantly influence our business. The reimbursement system in the U.S. In the U.S., our biggest market, most of our patients are insured by the governmental health authority, the so-called Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS). In fiscal year 2020, around 32 % of our revenue was attributable to reimbursements by CMS, which also determines the reimbursement rates for its patients (Medicare / Medicaid patients). Due to pressure to reduce health care costs, increases in the reimbursement rate were limited in the U.S. in the past. As a consequence, the reimbursement rate set by CMS as part of its prospective payment system (PPS) for chronic kidney failure treatments (known as the ESRD PPS rate) barely changed year- on-year. The ESRD PPS rate for 2020 amounted to $239.33, up 1.7 % on the 2019 base rate. A reimbursement rate of $253.13 per treatment has been determined for 2021 and includes a productivity-adjusted market basket increase of 1.6 %. While this represents a 5.8 % increase on the 2020 base rate, the majority of the increase is attributable to the inclusion of calci- mimetic drugs in the base rate beginning in 2021. From 2018 through 2020, CMS reimbursed dialysis facilities through the Transitional Drug Add-on Payment Adjustment (TDAPA) for cal- cimimetic drugs. Using cost and utilization data from Q3 2018 through Q4 2019, CMS has determined that $9.93 should be added to the base rate to account for calcimimetic drug use going forward. Beginning in 2021, dialysis facilities will be expected to provide calcimimetic drugs to patients without an additional add-on payment. Any significant reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on our health care ser- vices business. As demand for dialysis products is affected by Medicare reimbursement rates, this could have consequences for the development of our product business. To the extent that inflation, for example in the form of higher costs for personnel and disposables, is not fully compensated by an increase in reimbursement rates, our business and results of operations may also be adversely affected. More information can be found in the Results of operations, financial position and net assets section starting on page 45 and in the report on risks and opportunities starting on page 62. In the U.S., reimbursement by private insurers and managed care organizations is higher than reimbursement by govern- ment institutions. At the same time, payments from private insurers constitute a substantial portion of our profits, mean- ing our business is directly influenced by changes in the share of reimbursements by private insurers in North America. In fis- cal year 2020, 36 % of the Groups health care revenue was related to private insurers in the North America Segment. Transitional add-on payments for new drugs and devices in the U.S. Under the ESRD PPS drug designation process, CMS provides payment using a TDAPA for new renal dialysis drugs and bio- logicals with the exception of drugs that are available only in oral forms. For drug and biologicals that fit into an existing ESRD PPS functional category, CMS will pay for the drug using the TDAPA for two years. At the end of the transitional period, CMS will not update the base rate to reflect the cost and utiliza- tion of the new drug. For new drugs and biologicals that do not fit into an existing functional category, CMS will pay for the drug using the TDAPA for a period of at least two years to allow for sufficient gathering of cost and utilization data. At the con- clusions of the transitional period, CMS would update the base rate to reflect the inclusion of the new drug or biological. Beginning in 2021, CMS will also make transitional add-on pay- ments for certain new and innovative dialysis equipment and supplies (TPNIES) approved after January 1, 2020 and provided by dialysis facilities. These new equipment and supplies must satisfy defined material clinical improvement criteria and will be reimbursed at 65 % of the invoice price, as determined by each Medicare Administrative Contractor. Applications for the TPNIES are due by February 1 of the year prior to the add-on payment year. For 2021, CMS reviewed two TPNIES applica- tions. Nether application was approved and there will be no TPNIES payment for 2021. The TPNIES does not apply to equipment that constitute a cap- ital asset such as dialysis machines or water purification sys- tems. Beginning in 2022, however, CMS will make transitional add-on payments for capital equipment that are home dialysis machines used for the treatment of a single patient. Applica- tions for the home dialysis machine transitional payment for 2022 are due by February 2021. Quality-based reimbursement The health care debate in some countries is currently focused on establishing reimbursement structures based on treatment quality (pay for performance). This transfers more responsibil- ity to the medical service provider. The goal of reimbursement models of this kind is to maintain a high quality of care com- bined with lower overall costs for the health care system. The reimbursement system in the U.S. is also an example of a model based on qualitative criteria. For example, CMS defines quality standards for dialysis centers as part of its quality improvement program (QIP). Failure to reach these standards can lead to a reduction in annual reimbursements of up to 2 %. Reimbursement in a value-based environment in the U.S. We are also working closely with CMS in the area of value-based care. One example is our participation in a CMS ESRD care model: To improve the health of patients with chronic kidney failure while reducing costs for CMS, dialysis providers and phy- sicians can join forces to form entities known as ESCOs (End- Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Seamless Care Organizations). We are currently participating in 23 ESCOs in this pilot project. ESCOs that fulfill the minimum quality standards specified by the program while generating reductions in the cost of care above certain thresholds for dialysis patients covered by the model receive a portion of the cost savings as reimbursement. ESCOs that involve dialysis chains with more than 200 clinics are required to share in the risk of cost increases and reim- burse part of any such increases to CMS if the actual costs exceed the agreed thresholds. Approximately 43,700 patients participated in our ESCOs as of December 1, 2020. In 2020, CMS gave each ESCO the option to extend their participation in the program through March 31, 2021, and / or to accept certain financial changes. Fresenius Medical Care will continue to par- ticipate in the ESCO program. We have also concluded agreements on per capita reimburse- ments (subcapitations) as well as risk-based and value-based agreements with certain insurers, which form the basis for the health care services we offer to private and Medicare Advan- tage patients with chronic kidney failure. These agreements determine a basic amount per patient per month. If we provide complete care at a cost below this amount, we retain the differ- ence. However, if the cost of complete care exceeds the basic amount, we may be obliged to pay the difference to the insurer. 2019 Executive Order on new reimbursement models On July 10, 2019, the U.S. President signed an Executive Order (EO) on advancing kidney health. Among other things, the EO directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop new Medicare reimbursement models that enable diag- nosis and treatment earlier in the course of kidney disease and support the expansion of home dialysis as well as promoting kidney transplants. One of these, the ESRD Treatment Choices Model (ETC Model), is mandatory and creates financial incen- tives for home dialysis treatments and kidney transplants. Due to start in January 2021 and end in June 2026, the ETC Model consists of two partial reimbursement programs: on the one hand it envisages increases to the reimbursement for home dialysis treatments for a period of three years, on the other hand a performance-based reimbursement adjustment on all dialysis claims. The performance-based reimbursement adjust- ment is based on the rates of home dialysis and kidney trans- plants and will amount to between - 5 and + 4 % in the first year of reimbursement and between - 10 and + 8 % in the final year. Performance based payment adjustments are scheduled to start in July 2022 and run for six and a half years. Participants in the model are selected at random. As at December 2020, 975 U.S. dialysis clinics, representing approximately 35 % of our dialysis clinics, were selected for participation in the model. The Executive Order also announced voluntary Medicare reim- bursement models aimed at providing financial incentives for health care providers in the area of chronic kidney disease and transplantation. Our applications for the voluntary Compre- hensive Kidney Care Contracting (CKCC) model were accepted in June 2020. This model allows health care providers to assume various amounts of financial risk by forming so-called Kidney Care Entities (KCE). Of the 29 accepted applications, 27 KCEs have elected to participate in the implementation period, which started on October 15, 2020. During a start-up period, the KCE is not at financial risk. Each KCE must decide before April 1, 2021, whether to continue its participation includ- ing financial accountability in the first performance year from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Once implemented, the CKCC model is expected to run through 2025. Changes related to the Affordable Care Act The delivery of health care services and products is highly regulated in most of the countries in which we operate. Pro- posals for legislative reforms in these countries are often introduced to improve access to care, address quality of care issues, and manage costs of the health care system. In the U.S., the Trump administration publicly announced its desire to pursue significant changes to existing health care pro- grams. This has included the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, which regulates access to health insur- ance in the U.S. In October 2017, the Trump administration discontinued making cost-sharing reduction (CSR) reimbursements to insurers, arguing that the Congress had failed to appropriate funding for them. These subsidies reduce deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments for individuals and families at or below 250 % of the federal poverty level. Under the law insurers are still man- dated to provide lower out-of-pocket costs for low-income indi- viduals; as a result, ending CSR payments has caused many insurers to increase premiums in the individual insurance mar- ket to offset the loss of the federal support. This occurred in part through so-called silver loading, a practice whereby the premiums for silver level plans were increased. In its financial year 2019, 2020, and 2021 budget proposals, the Trump administration altered course and requested authority to fund CSR payments. Neither the financial year 2019, 2020, nor 2021 CSR budget proposal was ultimately included in appropriations authorized by the Congress, and we cannot predict whether the inclusion of this funding for 2021 will come to pass. Although that administrations efforts to repeal or replace ACA were unsuccessful and the Biden Administration has stated its intention to maintain and strengthen the ACA, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in November 2020 regarding the constitutionality of the ACA. On January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Strength- ening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, which directs the Secretaries of the Departments of Health and Human Ser- vices, Treasury and Labor to, among other things, review and examine policies or practices. U.S. ballot initiatives Further U.S. legislation or regulations may be enacted in the future that could substantially modify the amounts paid for services and products that we and our subsidiaries offer. They could also mandate new or alternative operating models and payment models that could put our health care service opera- tions at greater risk. Ballot initiatives that are successfully introduced at state level in the U.S. require the states citizens to vote to directly adopt or reject the proposed new legislation. These ballot initiatives oblige us to spend considerable resources in order to participate in public discourse. Efforts to enact new state laws regarding our operations are ongoing. COVID-19 relief measures In the U.S., the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) has been passed to mitigate certain adverse financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including in the health care sector. Additional funding under the CARES Act and other COVID-19 relief provides some financial support to our business in the U.S. This includes suspension of the 2 % Medi- care payment sequestration reduction from May 2020 to March 2021, accelerated and advance payments of Medicare reim- bursement and grants to cover expenses and mitigate the loss of revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, these measures may not fully offset any lost revenues and increased costs we may incur. For further information see the consoli- dated financials within Results of operations, financial posi- tion and net assets starting on page 45 and NOTe 4 I of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Charitable Premium Assistance At the end of the Obama administration, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued an Interim Final Rule (IFR) that limited patients ability to use charitable pre- mium assistance (CPA) to enroll in a private scheme. In 2017, this IFR was temporarily enjoined after Fresenius Medical Care (along with DaVita, US Renal, and Dialysis Patients Citi- zens) sued CMS. The Trump administration has continued to work on this issue and sent a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing CPA to the Office of Management and Budget for review in June 2019. The proposed rule has not yet been published for comment. While the rule continues to be reflected in the Department of Health and Human Services agenda, there has been no indica- tion whether or when the rule will be released. Instead, there have been attempts to curtail the usage of CPA or reduce com- mercial reimbursement for dialysis patients receiving CPA by state legislatures. OVERALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT Highlights Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic Throughout 2020, Fresenius Medical Care reported COVID-19 affecting patients with advanced kidney disease and, in partic- ular, the severity of illness resulting in an increased mortality. The excess mortality trend significantly accelerated in the U.S. and in EMEA in particular in November and December 2020 and accumulated to approximately 10,000 patients in 2020 over the pre-pandemic baseline. To be able to continue care for its patients, Fresenius Medical Care implemented a number of measures, both operational and financial, to maintain an adequate workforce, protect its patients and employees through expanded personal protec- tive equipment protocols, and expenses related to surge capacity for patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID- 19. Additionally, we experienced a loss of revenue due to the pandemic in certain areas of our business, which was partially offset by increased demand for our services and products in other areas. Governments in various regions in which we operate have pro- vided economic assistance programs to address the conse- quences of the pandemic on companies and support healthcare providers and patients. After taking into account these COVID-19 reimbursements, Fresenius Medical Care concluded that COVID-19 resulted in an immaterial impact to net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA in 2020. For more information see the consolidated financials within Results of operations, financial position and net assets start- ing on page 45 and NOTe 4 I of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Share buy-back program In 2020, we continued to utilize the authorization granted by the Companys Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2016 to con- duct a share buy-back program. Under a share buy-back pro- gram, announced on June 14, 2019 and concluded on April 1, 2020, we repurchased 10.8 M ordinary shares at a total pur- chase price (excluding ancillary transaction costs) of 685 M. These shares were used solely to reduce our registered share capital by cancellation of the acquired shares. On December 11, 2020, all 11.8 M own shares held were redeemed. For further information See NOTe 17 of the notes to the consolidated finan- cial statements. Financing On May 29, 2020, we issued bonds in two tranches with an aggregate principal amount of 1.25 BN under our Debt Issu- ance Program: a 500 M bond with a six-year maturity and a coupon rate of 1.00 % issued at a price of 99.405 % and with a yield of 1.103 %; and a 750 M bond with a ten-year maturity and a coupon rate of 1.50 % issued at a price of 99.742 % and with a yield of 1.528 %. On September 16, 2020, we issued further bonds with a ten- year maturity and an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 BN. The bonds have a coupon rate of 2.375 % ad were issued at a price of 99.699 % with a yield of 2.408 %. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including refinancing of financial liabilities. Comparison of actual business results with the outlook The rapid global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a material deterioration of the conditions for the global econ- omy. The environment for our business did not evolve as expected in 2020. Nevertheless, taking into account the gov- ernmental COVID-19 reimbursements, we concluded that COVID-19 resulted in an immaterial impact on net income attrib- utable to shareholders. We largely met our forecasts for the fis- cal year 2020 despite the COVID-19-pandemic. Our 2020 outlook included the effects from COVID-19 and excluded special items. Special items are effects that are unusual in nature and have not been foreseeable, or not fore- seeable in size or impact, at the time of giving guidance. There- fore the outlook excluded the Impairment Loss in the Latin America Segment. Accordingly, we have adjusted for this spe- cial item the actual results for 2020 to make them comparable with the outlook. The growth rates are based on the results in 2019 adjusted for NxStage costs, costs associated with the sustainable improve- ment of our cost base (Cost Optimization Costs) and the (Gain) loss related to divestitures of Care Coordination activities. A reconciliation of the results 2020 and 2019 to the respective results 2020 excluding special items and results 2019 adjusted can be found at the end of this section. The outlook for the fis- cal year 2020 was based on the prevailing exchange rates at the beginning of 2020. We expected revenue growth in the mid to high single digit range at Constant Currency at the beginning of the year. We generated revenue of 17.9 BN in 2020. At Constant Currency, revenue increased by 5 %. We therefore met our expectations and achieved our outlook. All operating segments, and especially the North America Seg- ment contributed to the expansion of our business. Further details on the development of revenue can be found in the sec- tion Results of operation, financial position and net assets starting on page 45. We expected operating income to develop at a mid to high sin- gle digit growth rate at Constant Currency in the fiscal year 2020. Operating income excluding special items in 2020 was 2.5 BN, an increase by 8 % at Constant Currency on an adjusted prior year basis. This lies in the upper end of our out- look and we therefore met our expectations. We also expected Delivered Operating Income to develop at a mid to high single digit growth rate at Constant Currency in 2020. Delivered Operating Income excluding special items in 2020 was 2.2 BN, an increase by 7 % at Constant Currency on an adjusted prior year basis. This is in line with our expecta- tions, therefore we met our outlook as well. At the beginning of the year, we set a target range for net income development at a mid to high single digit growth rate at Constant Currency. Net income excluding special items in 2020 increased to 1.4 BN. This increase at Constant Currency by 12 % on an adjusted prior year basis slightly exceeded our expectations. Basic earnings per share excluding special items increased at Constant Currency by 15 % on an adjusted prior year basis. This increase is in line with the development of net income excluding special items and shares outstanding, as we expected. We earmarked 1.1 BN to 1.3 BN for capital expenditures in 2020. With an outlay of 1.0 BN, we have not met outlook due to postponement of capital expenditures. We expected to spend around 0.5 BN to 0.7 BN on acquisitions and investments. We made acquisitions and investments (excluding investments in debt securities) for 0.3 BN, this is slightly below of our expectations due to postponement of acquisitions and invest- ments. For further information on capital expenditures, acquisi- tions, and investments see section Results of operation, finan- cial position and net assets starting on page 45. Driven by earnings development, but primarily due to U.S. fed- eral relief funding and advanced payments under the CARES Act and other COVID-19 relief, including lower tax payments in the North America Segment net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in percent of revenue was high at 24 %, exceeding our expectation of greater than 12.5 %. Free cash flow accounted for 18 % of revenue in 2020, which also exceeded our expectation for the same reasons of greater than 5 %. According to our forecast the net leverage ratio should have been below 3.5 at the end of 2020. The net leverage ratio was 2.7 at the balance sheet date and is therefore as expected. ROIC was at 5.8 %. Driven by the Impairment Loss this mea- sure is lower than our expectation of at least 6.0 %. A dividend per share of 1.34 planned to propose to be approved by the Annual General Meeting on May 20, 2021 is within our expectation (in line with the development of net income and shares outstanding). The number of our employees (full-time equivalents) increased from 120,659 at the end of 2019 to 125,364 at the end of 2020. The number of employees therefore met our expectations of more than 124,000 full-time equivalents. T 2.23 RESULTS AND OUTLOOK FOR 2020 Results 2020 excl. Outlook 2020 Research and development expenditures aimed at boosting our ability to adapt to future requirements amounted to 194 M, this is below our adjusted expected range of 200 to 220 M due to lower than expected project costs and postponement of project costs. The initial outlook for research and development expenses for 2020 of 210 to 230 M was adjusted during the third quarter to 200 to 220 M. Our research and develop- ment activities are focused on developing innovative products and renal therapies. TaBLe 2.23 shows the actual results and our outlook for 2020. TaBLeS 2.24 aND 2.25 ON page 45 provide a reconciliation of the results 2020 and 2019 to the respective results 2020 and 2019 adjusted. 1 Outlook 2020 included the effects from COVID-19 and excluded special items, such as the Impairment Loss in the Latin America Segment. Special items are effects that are unusual in nature and have not been foreseeable or not foreseeable in size or impact at the time of giving guidance. The growth rates are based on the results in 2019 adjusted for NxStage Costs, Cost Optimization Costs and the (Gain) loss related to divestitures of Care Coordination activities. 2 Results 2020 were adjusted for special items in order to make the business performance comparable to Outlook 2020.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND NET ASSETS The following sections summarize our results of operations, financial position and net assets as well as key performance indicators by reporting segment, as well as Corporate, for the periods indicated. We prepared the information consistent with the manner in which management internally disaggregates financial information to assist in making operating decisions and evaluating management performance. Results of operations For further information on the results of operations of Fresenius Medical Care, See TaBLe 2.26. Revenue and operating income generated in countries outside the eurozone are subject to currency fluctuations. TaBLe 2.27 ON page 46 summarizes the development of the euro against the U.S. dollar as well as the revenue and the operating income, as a percentage of the consolidated results, generated in U.S. dollars for the years ended December 31, 2020 and Decem- ber 31, 2019.

Health care services revenue increased by 2 % compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition to a 3 % nega- tive impact from foreign currency translation, health care ser- vices revenue increased by 5 % driven by organic growth (+ 3 %) despite lower reimbursement for calcimimetics, the absence in 2020 of a revenue recognition adjustment for accounts receivable in legal dispute previously recorded in the prior year (+ 2 %) (See NOTe 22 of the notes to the consol- idated financial statements) and contributions from acquisi- tions (+ 1 %), partially offset by the effect of closed or sold clinics (- 1 %). Dialysis treatments increased by 3 % as a result of Same Market Treatment Growth and contributions from acquisitions, partially offset by the effect of closed or sold clinics. At December 31, 2020, we owned, operated or managed 4,092 dialysis clinics compared to 3,994 dialysis clinics at December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we acquired 60 dialysis clinics, opened 106 dialysis clinics and combined or closed 68 clinics. The number of patients treated in dialysis clinics that we own, operate or manage increased slightly to 346,553 at December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: 345,096), though this slight increase was impacted by the excess mortality rates among patients due to COVID-19 (COVID- 19 Related Excess Mortality Rates) in certain of our operating segments which are further described in the discussions below. Health care product revenue increased by 4 %. Including a 3 % negative impact from foreign currency translation, health care product revenue increased by 7 %. Dialysis product revenue increased by 3 %. In addition to a 4 % negative impact from foreign currency translation, dialysis product revenue increased by 7 % driven by higher sales of products for acute care treat- ments, in-center disposables, renal pharmaceuticals, home hemodialysis products and peritoneal dialysis products, par- tially offset by lower sales of machines for chronic treatment. Non-dialysis product revenue increased by 34 % to 101 M from 76 M, with virtually no impact from foreign currency transla- tion. The increase in non-dialysis product revenue was due to higher sales of acute cardiopulmonary products. The increase period over period in the gross profit margin of 31.0 % (2019: 30.9 %) was 0.1 percentage points. Foreign cur- rency translation effects represented a 0.2 percentage point increase in the current period. The resulting slight decrease at Constant Exchange Rates was primarily driven by various smaller impacts on the margin including higher personnel expense and an unfavorable impact from pharmacy services in the North America Segment, impacts from COVID-19 on costs, unfavorable foreign currency transaction effects in the EMEA Segment and the Asia-Pacific Segment, higher personnel expense in certain countries in the EMEA Segment, an unfavor- able impact from inflation (including hyperinflation in Argen- tina) and higher treatment costs in the Latin America Segment as well as start-up costs for dialysis clinics in the Asia-Pacific Segment. These various impacts were mostly offset by the absence in 2020 of a revenue recognition adjustment for accounts receivable in legal dispute previously recorded in the prior year and lower costs for renal pharmaceuticals. The increase period over period in selling, general and adminis- trative (SG&A) expense as a percentage of revenue of 17.7 % (2019: 17.5 %) was 0.2 percentage points. Foreign currency translation effects represented a 0.1 percentage point increase in the current period. The increase was primarily driven by the Impairment Loss in the Latin America Segment (See NOTe 2 a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). The increase was also impacted by the prior year remeasurement effect on the fair value of investments (North America Seg- ment) and the reduction of a contingent consideration liability related to Xenios AG (Xenios) in 2019 (EMEA Segment) as well as higher costs related to the compliance monitor engaged in accordance with the DOJ and SEC non-prosecution agree- ment (See NOTe 22 of the notes the consolidated financial statements) (Corporate). The increases were partially offset by the prior year impacts from (a) costs associated with the sus- tained improvement of our cost base (Costs Optimization Costs) and (b) a revenue recognition adjustment for accounts receiv- able in legal dispute in 2019, current year impacts from COVID- 19-related meeting and travel savings in the North America Segment and various, smaller effects across our segments. Research and development expenses increased by 15 % to 194 M from 168 M. The period over period increase as a per- centage of revenue, was 0.1 percentage points, largely driven by in-center and critical care program development as well as activities in the fields of digital connectivity and regenerative medicine and research and development activities at NxStage, partially offset by increased capitalization of research and development expenses in 2020. Income from equity method investees increased by 28 % to 95 M from 74 M. The increase was primarily driven by higher T 2.28 KEY INDICATORS FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Change in % Net interest expense decreased by 14 % to 368 M from 429 M. In addition to a 2 % positive impact from foreign cur- rency translation, net interest expense decreased by 12 % pri- marily due to lower interest rates driven by the replacement of high interest-bearing bonds by debt instruments at lower inter- est rates, lower variable Libor-based interest rates and lower interest rates on lease liabilities. Income tax expense increased by 25 % to 501 M from 402 M. The effective tax rate increased to 25.9 % from 21.8 % for the same period of 2019 largely driven by the non-deductible Impairment Loss (See NOTe 2 a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements) and the prior year tax benefit related to the divestiture of Sound. 1 For further information on Constant Currency, see chapter Overview of the Group section Performance management system starting on page 24. 2 Same market treatment growth represents growth in treatments, adjusted for certain reconciling items including (but not limited to) treatments from acquisitions, closed or sold clinics and differences in dialysis days (Same Market Treatment Growth). 3 For further information on Delivered Operating Income, including a reconciliation of Delivered Operating Income to operating income on a consolidated basis and for each of our operating segments, see chapter Overview of the Group section Performance management system starting on page 24. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by 14 % to 271 M from 239 M. In addition to a 2 % positive impact from foreign currency translation, net income attribut- able to noncontrolling interests increased by 16 % due to higher earnings in entities in which we have less than 100 % ownership. Net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA decreased by 3 % to 1,164 M from 1,200 M. In addition to a 2 % negative impact from foreign currency translation, net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA income from Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd., an entity in which we have ownership of 45 %, mainly due to higher sales of renal pharmaceuticals, income from the sale of a license for certain renal pharmaceuticals and lower operating expenses, partially offset by the impairment of a license held based on an unfavorable clinical trial. The decrease period over period in the operating income mar- gin was 0.1 percentage points. Foreign currency translation effects represented a 0.1 percentage point increase in the cur- rent period. The decrease was largely driven by the increase in SG&A expenses, partially offset by the increase in the gross profit margin, as discussed above. Delivered Operating Income remained relatively stable as com- pared to the prior year. In addition to a 2 % negative impact from foreign currency translation, Delivered Operating Income increased by 2 % largely driven by increased operating income, partially offset by an increase in income attributable to non- controlling interests. decreased by 1 % driven by the combined effects of the items discussed above. COVID-19 resulted in a negative impact to net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA in the amount of 49 M for the year ended December 31, 2020. Basic earnings per share remained relatively stable as com- pared to the prior year. In addition to a 2 % negative impact from foreign currency translation, basic earnings per share increased by 2 % primarily due to a decrease in the average weighted number of shares outstanding for the period. The average weighted number of shares outstanding for the period decreased to approximately 294.1 M in 2020 (2019: 302.7 M), primarily as a result of our share buy-back program which was concluded on April 1, 2020 (See NOTe 17 of the notes to the con- solidated financial statements). We employed 125,364 people (full-time equivalents) as of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: 120,659). This 4 % increase was primarily due to organic business growth and acquisitions, both of which were impacted by COVID-19 related personnel requirements. Segment reporting The following discussions pertain to the North America Seg- ment, the EMEA Segment, the Asia-Pacific Segment and the Latin America Segment and the measures we use to manage these segments. North America Segment Information about key indicators for the North America Seg- ment can be found in TaBLe 2.29. Dialysis T 2.29 KEY INDICATORS FOR THE NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT Change in % Revenue Dialysis revenue increased by 1 %, including a 3 % negative impact resulting from foreign currency translation. At Constant Exchange Rates, dialysis revenue increased by 4 %. Dialysis revenue is comprised of dialysis care revenue and health care product revenue. Dialysis care revenue increased by 1 % to 10,057 M from 9,973 M. In addition to a 2 % negative impact from foreign currency translation, dialysis care revenue increased by 3 % mainly due to the absence in 2020 of a revenue recognition adjustment for accounts receivable in legal dispute previously 1 For further information on Constant Currency, see chapter Overview of the Group section Performance management system starting on page 24. 2 For further information on Delivered Operating Income, including a reconciliation of Delivered Operating Income to operating income for each of our operating segments, see chapter Overview of the Group section Performance management system starting on page 24. recorded in the prior year (+ 2 %) (See NOTe 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements) and contributions from acquisitions (+ 1 %). Dialysis treatments increased by 2 % largely due to Same Mar- ket Treatment Growth. At December 31, 2020, 210,260 patients (December 31, 2019: 211,064) were treated in the 2,639 dialysis clinics (December 31, 2019: 2,579) that we own or operate in the North America Segment. The decrease in patients was driven by COVID-19 Related Excess Mortality Rates. Health care product revenue increased by 7 %. In addition to a 3 % negative impact from foreign currency translation, health care product revenue increased by 10 % driven by higher sales of products for acute care treatments, renal pharmaceuticals, in-center disposables and peritoneal dialysis products, partially offset by lower sales of machines for chronic treatment and home hemodialysis products. Operating income margin The increase period over period in the dialysis operating income margin was 2.1 percentage points, with virtually no impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by a favorable impact related to the absence in 2020 of a revenue recognition adjustment for accounts receivable in legal dispute previously recorded in the prior year, Cost Optimi- zation Costs in the prior year, a higher reimbursement rate and lower costs for renal pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the remeasurement effect on the fair value of investments in the prior year and higher personnel expense. Delivered Operating Income Dialysis Delivered Operating Income increased by 16 %. In addi- tion to a 2 % negative impact from foreign currency transla- tion, Delivered Operating Income increased by 18 % mainly as a result of increased operating income, partially offset by an increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Care Coordination Revenue Care Coordination revenue increased by 10 %. In addition to a 3 % negative impact from foreign currency translation, Care Coordination revenue increased by 13 % largely driven by an increase in organic growth impacted by the prior year effect of a reduction in patient attribution and a decreasing savings rate for ESCOs (Prior Year ESCO Effect) (+ 17 %), partially offset by the effect of closed or sold centers (- 4 %). Operating income margin The increase period over period in the Care Coordination oper- ating income margin was 4.2 percentage points, with virtually no impact from foreign currency translation in the current period. The increase was mainly due to the Prior Year ESCO Effect, a favorable impact from vascular access services driven by lower operating costs and higher volumes of procedures as well as a favorable impact of the divestiture from loss-making urgent care services, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from pharmacy services. Delivered Operating Income Care Coordination Delivered Operating Income increased by 130 %. In addition to a 4 % negative impact from foreign cur- rency translation, Delivered Operating Income increased by 134 % mainly as a result of increased operating income, par- tially offset by an increase in income attributable to noncon- trolling interests. EMEA Segment Information about key indicators for the EMEA Segment can be found in TaBLe 2.30 ON page 50. Revenue Health care service revenue increased by 1 %. Including a 3 % negative impact resulting from foreign currency translation, health care service revenue increased by 4 % largely as a result of an increase in organic growth (+ 3 %) and contribu- tions from acquisitions (+ 2 %), partially offset by the effect of closed or sold clinics (- 1 %). Dialysis treatments increased by 1 % mainly due to Same Mar- ket Treatment Growth and contributions from acquisitions, par- tially offset by the effect of closed or sold clinics. As of Decem- ber 31, 2020, 66,008 patients (December 31, 2019: 66,217) were treated at the 804 dialysis clinics (December 31, 2019: 781) that we own, operate or manage in the EMEA Segment. The decrease in patients was driven by COVID-19 Related Excess Mortality Rates. Health care product revenue increased by 4 %. Including a 3 % negative impact from foreign currency translation, health care product revenue increased by 7 %. Dialysis product revenue increased by 3 %. Including a 3 % negative impact from foreign currency translation, dialysis product revenue increased by 6 % due to higher sales of products for acute care treatments and home hemodialysis products, partially offset by lower sales of machines for chronic treatment. Non-Dialysis product reve- nue increased by 24 % to 95 M from 76 M. Including a 1 % negative impact from foreign currency translation, non-dialysis product revenue increased by 25 % largely due to higher sales of acute cardiopulmonary products. Operating income margin The decrease period over period in the operating income margin was 1.7 percentage points. Foreign currency translation effects represented a 0.1 percentage point increase in the operating income margin. The decrease was mainly due to the reduction of a contingent consideration liability related to Xenios in the prior year period, unfavorable foreign currency T 2.30 KEY INDICATORS FOR THE EMEA SEGMENT Change in % ber 31, 2020, 33,106 patients (December 31, 2019: 33,005) were treated at the 400 dialysis clinics (December 31, 2019: 400) that we own, operate or manage in the Asia-Pacific Segment. Health care product revenue increased by 2 %. Including a 2 % negative impact resulting from foreign currency transla- tion, health care product revenue increased by 4 %. Dialysis product revenue increased by 2 %. Including a 2 % negative impact from foreign currency translation, dialysis product revenue increased by 4 % due to higher sales of products for acute care treatments, in-center disposables and peritoneal dialysis products, partially offset by lower sales of machines for chronic treatment. Non-Dialysis product revenue increased to 5 M (2019: 0 M) due to higher sales of acute cardiopul- monary products. 1 For further information on Constant Currency, see chapter Overview of the Group section Performance management system starting on page 24. 2 For further information on Delivered Operating Income, including a reconciliation of Delivered Operating Income to operating income for each of our operating segments, see chapter Overview of the Group section Performance management system starting on page 24.

Delivered Operating Income Delivered Operating Income decreased by 8 %. Including a 2 % negative impact resulting from foreign currency translation, Delivered Operating Income decreased by 6 % primarily due to decreased operating income. Asia-Pacific Segment Information about key indicators for the Asia-Pacific Segment can be found in TaBLe 2.31 ON page 51. Dialysis Revenue Dialysis revenue increased by 2 %, including a 1 % negative impact resulting from foreign currency translation. At Constant Exchange Rates, dialysis revenue increased by 3 % dialysis rev- enue is comprised of dialysis care revenue and health care product revenue. Dialysis care service revenue increased by 1 % to 627 M from 621 M, with virtually no impact resulting from foreign cur- rency translation. The increase was as a result of organic growth (+ 5 %) and contributions from acquisitions (+ 1 %), largely offset by the effect of closed or sold clinics (- 5 %). Dialysis treatments increased by 2 % mainly due to Same Mar- ket Treatment Growth and contributions from acquisitions, par- tially offset by the effect of closed or sold clinics. As of Decem- effects represented a 0.2 percentage point increase in the operating income margin. The increase was primarily due to a gain from the deconsolidation of clinics and COVID-19-related travel savings, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency transaction effects. Delivered Operating Income Delivered Operating Income increased by 7 %, with virtually no impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was mainly due to increased operating income. Care Coordination Revenue Care Coordination revenue increased by 3 %. Including a 2 % negative impact resulting from foreign currency translation, Care Coordination revenue increased by 5 % driven by contri- butions from acquisitions (+ 7 %), partially offset by a decrease T 2.31 KEY INDICATORS FOR THE ASIA-PACIFIC SEGMENT Change in % in organic growth (- 2 %) impacted by the negative effects of COVID-19. Operating income margin The decrease period over period in the Care Coordination oper- ating income margin was 3 percentage points. Foreign currency translation effects represented a 0.1 percentage point decrease in the operating income margin. The decrease was driven by unfavorable effects related to COVID-19 and an unfavorable mix effect from acquisitions with lower margins. Delivered Operating Income Care Coordination Delivered Operating Income decreased by 14 %. Including a 2 % negative impact resulting from foreign currency translation, Care Coordination Delivered Operating Income decreased by 12 % mainly as a result of decreased operating income. Latin America Segment Information about key indicators for the Latin America Seg- ment can be found in TaBLe 2.32 ON page 52. 1 For further information on Constant Currency, see chapter Overview of the Group section Performance management system starting on page 24. 2 For further information on Delivered Operating Income, including a reconciliation of Delivered Operating Income to operating income for each of our operating segments, see chapter Overview of the Group section Performance management system starting on page 24. Revenue Health care service revenue decreased by 3 %. Including a 26 % negative impact resulting from foreign currency transla- tion, health care service revenue increased by 23 % as a result of increases in organic growth (+ 15 %) and contributions from acquisitions (+ 8 %). Dialysis treatments increased by 9 % mainly due to contribu- tions from acquisitions and Same Market Treatment Growth. As of December 31, 2020, 37,179 patients, an increase of 7 % (December 31, 2019: 34,810), were treated at the 249 dialysis clinics (December 31, 2019: 234) that we own, operate or man- age in the Latin America Segment. T 2.32 KEY INDICATORS FOR THE LATIN AMERICA SEGMENT Change in % Financial management policies and goals Besides optimizing our financial costs, our financing strategy gives top priority to ensuring financial flexibility. We remain flexible by being highly diversified with regard to tenors, inves- tors and banks. Our financing profile is characterized by a wide range of maturities up to 2031. 1 For further information on Constant Currency, see chapter Overview of the Group section Performance management system starting on page 24. 2 For further information on Delivered Operating Income, including a reconciliation of Delivered Operating Income to operating income for each of our operating segments, see chapter Overview of the Group section Performance management system starting on page 24. Our main mid- and long-term financing instruments are bonds in euro and U.S. dollar as well as the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement (a syndicated credit agreement with revolving credit facilities and long-term loans in U.S. dollar and euro). Short-term financing needs are covered by issuances under our commercial paper program in euro, the Accounts Receiv- able Facility in U.S. dollar and bilateral credit facilities. In our long-term financial planning, we focus primarily on the net leverage ratio, a non-IFRS measure. At December 31, 2020, the net leverage ratio was 2.7 (2019: 3.2). See Performance management system - Net leverage ratio (Non-IFRS Mea- sure) starting on page 26. Health care product revenue decreased by 5 %. Including a 22 % negative impact resulting from foreign currency transla- tion, health care product revenue increased by 17 % due to higher sales of in-center disposables, products for acute care treatments and machines for chronic treatment. Operating income margin The decrease period over period in the operating income mar- gin was 28.9 percentage points. Foreign currency translation effects represented a 5.1 percentage point decrease in the operating income margin in the current period. The decrease was mainly impacted by the Impairment Loss (See NOTe 2 a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). Delivered Operating Income Delivered Operating Income decreased to a loss of 157 M for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a Delivered Operating Income of 42 M in the comparative period of 2019 due to the Impairment Loss noted above. Financial position Our investment and financing strategy did not change substan- tially in the past fiscal year as our business model, which is based on stable and high cash flows, allows for a reasonable proportion of debt. We regard our refinancing options as being very stable and flexible. During the past fiscal year, the focus of our investing activities was on our health care services business. The key financial risks we are exposed to include foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. To manage these risks, we enter into various hedging transactions that have been autho- rized by the Management Board with banks which generally have ratings in the A category or better. We do not use finan- cial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes (for financial risks, see section Other risks in chapter Risks and opportunities report starting on page 71 as well as NOTe 23 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). Fresenius SE, under a service agreement, conducts financial instrument activities for us under the control of a single centralized department. We have established guidelines for risk management procedures and controls which govern the use of financial instruments. These guidelines include a clear segrega- tion of duties with regards to execution on the one hand and administration, accounting and controlling on the other. We also utilize Fresenius SEs cash management system as well as an unsecured loan agreement with Fresenius SE (See NOTe 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). Rating We are rated investment grade by the three leading rating agencies, Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch (See TaBLe 2.33). T 2.33 RATING 1 Standard & Poors Moodys Fitch Corporate credit rating BBB Baa3 BBB- Outlook stable stable stable 1 A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities of the Company, and may be subject to suspension, change or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Effect of off-balance-sheet financing instruments on our financial position, assets and liabilities We are not involved in off-balance-sheet transactions that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, cash requirements or capital resources. Sources of liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are typically cash provided by operating activities, cash provided by short-term debt, pro- ceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and divestitures. We require this capital primarily to finance working capital needs, fund acquisitions, operate clinics, develop free-standing renal dialysis clinics and other health care facilities, purchase equip- ment for existing or new renal dialysis clinics and production sites, repay debt, pay dividends and repurchase shares, (see Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities starting on page 54 and Net cash provided by (used in) financing activi- ties starting on page 55). At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of 1,082 M (December 31, 2019: 1,008 M). As of December 31, 2020, our available borrowing capacity resulting from unutilized credit facilities amounted to approxi- mately 2.4 billion. The Amended 2012 Credit Agreement accounted for approximately 1.3 billion in unutilized available borrowing capacity. Free cash flow (net cash provided by (used in) operating activi- ties, after capital expenditures, before acquisitions and invest- ments) in 2020 amounted to 3,197 M (2019: 1,454 M). Free cash flow is a Non-IFRS Measure and is reconciled to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable IFRS measure in section Performance manage- ment system starting on page 24. Free cash flow accounted for 17.9 % of revenue in 2020 (2019: 8.3 %). Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities During 2020 we generated net cash provided by operating activities of 4,233 M (2019: 2,567 M). Net cash provided by operating activities accounted for 24 % of revenue in 2020 (2019: 15 %). Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities is impacted by the profitability of our business, the develop- ment of our working capital, principally inventories, receivables and cash outflows that occur due to a number of specific items as discussed below. The increase in net cash provided by oper- ating activities in 2020 was largely driven by U.S. federal relief funding and advanced payments under the CARES Act and other COVID-19 relief (See NOTe 4 I of the notes to the consoli- dated financial statements), including lower tax payments in the North America Segment, partially offset by an increase in inventory levels related to a higher demand for specific prod- ucts and higher safety inventory levels due to COVID-19. The profitability of our business depends significantly on reim- bursement rates for our services. Approximately 79 % of our revenue is generated by providing health care services, a major portion of which is reimbursed by either public health care organizations or private insurers. In 2020, approximately 32 % of our consolidated revenue was attributable to reimburse- ments from U.S. federal health care benefit programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Legislative changes could affect Medi- care reimbursement rates for a significant portion of the ser- vices we provide, as well as the scope of Medicare coverage. A decrease in reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and thus on our capacity to generate cash flow. In recent years, the stability of reimbursement in the U.S. has been affected by (i) the implementation of the ESRD PPS in January 2011, (ii) across-the-board spending cuts in payments to Medicare providers by the U.S. federal government, com- monly referred to as U.S. Sequestration, (iii) the phased reduction to the ESRD PPS rate to account for the decline in utilization of certain drugs and biologicals associated with dial- ysis pursuant to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 as subsequently modified under the Protecting Access to Medi- care Act of 2014 and (iv) CMSs 2017 final rule on the Physician Fee Schedule, which partially corrected reimbursement for certain procedures that were materially undervalued in 2016. We intend to continue to address our current cash and financ- ing requirements using net cash provided by operating activi- ties, our existing and future credit agreements, issuances under our commercial paper program (See NOTe 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements) as well as from the use of our Accounts Receivable Facility. In addition, to finance acquisitions or meet other needs, we expect to successfully complete long-term financing arrangements, such as the issu- ance of bonds. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities depends on the collection of accounts receivable. Commercial customers and government institutions generally have different payment cycles. Lengthening their payment cycles could have a material adverse effect on our capacity to generate cash flow. In addi- tion, we could face difficulties enforcing and collecting accounts T 2.34 DEVELOPMENT OF DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING IN DaYS December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Increase / decrease primarily driven by: North America Segment 26 58 advanced payments under the CARES Act EMEA Segment 90 96 improvement of payment collections in the region Asia-Pacific Segment 110 improvement of payment collections 113 in the region (mainly in China) Latin America Segment 134 periodic delays in payment of public health care 127 organizations in certain countries FMC AG & CO.

Capital expenditures, net Acquisitions, investments, purchases of intangi- ble assets and investments in debt securities DSO by segment is calculated by dividing the respective seg- ments accounts and other receivables from unrelated parties and contract liabilities, converted to euro using the average exchange rate for the period presented, less any sales or value added tax included in the receivables, by the average daily sales for the last twelve months of that segment, converted to euro using the average exchange rate for the period. Receiv- ables and revenues are adjusted for amounts related to acqui- sitions and divestitures made within the reporting period with a purchase price above a 50 M threshold as defined in the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement. The development of DSO by reporting segment is shown in TaBLe 2.34. Due to the fact that a large portion of our reimbursement is provided by public health care organizations and private insurers, we expect that most of our accounts receivable will be collectible. For information regarding litigation exposure as well as ongo- ing and future tax audits, See NOTe 22 of the notes to the con- solidated financial statements included in this report. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was 1,335 M for 2020 (2019: 3,286 M). TaBLe 2.35 shows our capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and capitalized development costs, net of proceeds from sales of property, plant and equip- ment as well as acquisitions, investments and purchases of intangible assets for 2020 and 2019. The majority of our capital expenditures were used for main- taining existing clinics, equipping new clinics, maintaining and expanding production facilities, capitalization of machines pro- vided to our customers and for Care Coordination as well as capitalization of certain development costs. Capital expendi- tures accounted for approximately 6 % of total revenue in 2020 (2019: 6 %). Acquisitions during 2019 were primarily driven by the acquisi- tion of NxStage on February 21, 2019 (See NOTe 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements) as well as dialysis clinics. In 2020, we received 57 M from divestitures. These divesti- tures were mainly related to the divestment of debt securities and certain research & development investments. In 2019, we received 60 M from divestitures. These divesti- tures were mainly related to the divestment of MedSpring Urgent Care Centers in Texas, sales of debt securities, the divestment of a California-based cardiovascular business and B.Braun Medical Inc.s purchase of NxStages bloodlines busi- ness in connection with our acquisition of NxStage. rity in January 2020, the early repayment of the EUR term loan 2017 / 2020 under the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement (origi- nally due on July 30, 2020) on May 29, 2020 and the repay- ment of bonds (originally due on October 15, 2020) on July 17, 2020), the repayment of lease liabilities (including lease liabili- ties from related parties), repayments of the Accounts Receiv- able Facility, distributions to noncontrolling interests, shares repurchased as part of a share buy-back program as well as payments of dividends, partially offset by proceeds from long- term debt (including proceeds from the issuance of bonds in an aggregate principal amount of 1,250 M on May 29, 2020 and the issuance of bonds in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000 M on September 16, 2020) and short-term debt (includ- ing short-term debt from related parties). In 2019, cash was mainly used in the repayments of long-term debt (including the current portion of long-term debt primarily driven by the repayment of bonds due in July 2019), repay- ments of short-term debt (including short-term debt from related parties), repayment of lease liabilities (including lease liabilities from related parties), shares repurchased as part of a share buy-back program, payment of dividends, and distribu- tions to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by proceeds from long-term debt (including the issuance of bonds with a volume of 1,750 M and $500 M as well as additional drawings under the revolving credit facilities of the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement), proceeds from short-term debt (including short- term debt from related parties) and the utilization of the Accounts Receivable Facility. On September 1, 2020, we paid a dividend of 1.20 per share for 2019 (1.17 per share for 2018 paid in 2019). The total dividend payment was 351 M in 2020 (2019: 355 M).

Actual results could differ from assumptions due to changing market, economic and governmental regulatory conditions, thereby resulting in an increase or decrease of liabilities. Employer contributions to be paid to the defined benefit plans during fiscal year 2021 are expected to amount to 1 M. For additional information regarding our pension plans and expected payments for the next ten years, See NOTe 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Further unconditional purchase agreements exist with an associated entity of the Company. For further information on these agreements, See NOTe 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 2 Includes expected interest payments based on fixed interest rates or expected variable interest rates taking into account the principal repayment schedules. To this end, the applicable interest rates (e.g. Libor, Euribor), the applicable margins, and the effects of related interest rate swaps were taken into consideration. 3 Other long-term obligations consist mainly of production asset acquisition commitments, take-or-pay utilities contracts and intangible asset acquisition commitments. 2012 Credit Agreement and Accounts Receivable Facility, we are obligated to not exceed a maximum consolidated net lever- age ratio as defined in these financing agreements. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all cove- nants under the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement and our other financing agreements. For information regarding our Amended 2012 Credit Agreement, bonds and the Accounts Receivable Facility, See NOTe 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. Although current and future economic conditions could adversely affect our business and our profitability, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our business while meeting our financial obligations as they come due. Due to the non-discretionary nature of the health care services we provide, the need for health care products utilized to provide such services and the availability of government reimburse- ment for a substantial portion of our health care services, our business is generally not cyclical. A substantial portion of our accounts receivable is generated by governmental payors. While payment and collection practices vary significantly between countries and even between agencies within one country, government payors usually represent low to moderate credit risk. However, limited or expensive access to capital could make it more difficult for our customers to do business with us, or to do business generally, which could adversely affect our business by causing our customers to reduce or delay their purchases of our health care products (see Results of operations above). If the conditions in the capital markets worsen, this could increase our financing costs and limit our financial flexibility. At our Annual General Meeting scheduled to be held on May 20, 2021, our General Partner and our Supervisory Board will pro- pose to the shareholders a dividend of 1.34 per share for 2020, payable in 2021 (for 2019 paid in 2020: 1.20). The total expected dividend payment is approximately 392 M compared to dividends of 351 M for 2019 paid in 2020. Our principal financing needs in 2021 relate to repayments of bonds due in February 2021, which were already pre-financed by the bonds issuance in September 2020, as well as amortiza- tions under our Amended 2012 Credit Agreement. The dividend payment in May 2021, anticipated capital expenditures, and further acquisition payments are expected to be covered by our cash flow, using existing credit facilities and, if required, additional debt financing. We currently have sufficient flexibil- ity under our debt covenants to meet our financing needs in the near future. Generally, we believe that we will have suffi- cient financing to achieve our goals in the future and to con- tinue to promote our growth. Net assets Our total consolidated assets in the past fiscal year were 31,689 M, a decrease of 1,246 M (4 %) over the prior year, including a negative foreign exchange impact of 8 %. Non-current assets decreased by 1,356 M (5 %) to 24,414 M in 2020 and represented 77 % of total assets (2019: 78 %). This decrease includes a negative foreign exchange impact of 7 %. Moreover, non-current assets increased primarily as a result of investments in property, plant and equipment and capitalized development costs as well as an increase in rights of use under leasing agreements, partially offset by a goodwill reduction due to the Impairment Loss in the Latin America Segment. Current assets increased by 2 % to 7,275 M. This was mainly the result of increased cash and cash equivalents related to U.S. federal relief funding and advance payments under the CARES Act and other COVID-19 relief, as well as increased other current assets mainly due to increased advance payments on invoices. Furthermore, increased finished goods driven by greater demand for specific products and higher safety inven- tory levels, both as a result of COVID-19, contributed to that increase. These were partially offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of 10 % and a decrease in trade accounts and other receivables from unrelated parties. Total liabilities were 19,358 M at December 31, 2020, a decrease of 350 M (2 %), including a positive foreign exchange impact of 6 %, from 19,708 M in 2019. This decrease was pri- marily the result of the reduction in short-term debt and the current portion of long-term liabilities. This was partially offset by the increase in other non-current liabilities as well as cur- rent provisions and other non-current liabilities, driven by advance payments received under the Medicare and Medicaid Accelerated and Advance Payment program (852 M), which were recorded as contract liability upon receipt and recognized as revenue when the services are provided. Current liabilities account for 1,088 M of our debt, a decrease of 1,531 M (58 %), including a positive foreign exchange impact of 3 %, from 2,619 M in the prior year. Furthermore, the decrease of short-term debt from unrelated parties was mainly a result of repayments under the commercial paper pro- gram, the equity-neutral convertible bonds, the U.S. dollar- denominated bonds and a euro-denominated term loan under the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement. The decrease was par- tially offset by the reclassification of U.S. dollar and Euro-de- nominated bonds to the current portion of long-term debt, as these will mature in 2021. Long-term debt increased to 6,800 M from 6,458 M in the prior year, an increase of 342 M (5 %), including a negative foreign exchange impact of 4 %. Furthermore, the increase of long-term debt was mainly a result of the issuance of bonds with a total volume of 1,250 M and $1,000 M. It was partially offset by the reclassification of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds and euro-denominated bonds as well as the quarterly repay- ments of the remaining term loans under the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement to the current portion of long-term debt, the repayment of revolving loans under the 2012 credit agreement and the reduction of the Accounts Receivable Facility. Shareholders equity decreased by 7 % to 12,331 M. The decrease was driven by a negative foreign exchange impact of 11 %, purchases of treasury stock as part of a share buy-back program, dividend payments and distributions to non-con- trolling interests. It was partially offset by the consolidated earnings and changes in fair value of equity and debt instru- ments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. The equity to assets ratio decreased to 39 % at Decem- ber 31, 2020 from 40 % at December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of the decrease in Equity as well as the increase in long- term debt as well as in current provisions and other current lia- bilities related to U.S. federal relief funding and advance pay- ments under the CARES Act and other COVID-19 relief. This was partially offset by a decrease in short-term debt and the cur- rent portion of long-term debt. At Group level, ROIC decreased to 5.8 % at December 31, 2020 from 6.1 % at December 31, 2019, driven by the Impairment Loss in the Latin America Segment. Excluding the Impairment Loss as well as excluding both the Impairment Loss and IFRS 16, ROIC was 6,6 % and 7.5 %, respectively, at December 31, 2020 (see reconciliation in section Performance management sys- tem, Return on invested capital on page 27). Goodwill, included in the item invested capital, has a significant impact on the calculation of the ROIC. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC), including weighted risk premiums for country risks, was 5.5 %. For supplementary information on capital management and our capital structure, See aLSO NOTe 18 of the notes to the con- solidated financial statements. Managements general assessment In 2020 we achieved our revenue and net income targets despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we are proposing our 24th consecutive dividend increase. While reported earnings in Q4 were negatively impacted by the impairment in the Latin America Segment and accelerated excess mortality due to COVID-19, we are on track regarding the growth in home dialysis. In order to maintain safe operations during the pandemic we have taken comprehensive measures that have resulted in significantly increased costs in the Dialy- sis Services business. Through governmental support, in par- ticular in the U.S., accelerated efficiency measures and a strong products business development, we managed to largely com- pensate these costs. At the time this Management Report was prepared, the Man- agement Board continued to assess the results of operations, financial position and net assets of Fresenius Medical Care as positive, even though the effects of the increase in excess mortality cannot be compensated. This will affect our earnings development in 2021. To support its 2025 strategy, further strengthen profitability and compensate for the negative earn- ings effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Fresenius Medical Care will launch its FME25 program. We confirm our 2025 targets that are based on the Company s mid-term strategy. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Refer to NOTe 27 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. OUTLOOK The outlook describes how Fresenius Medical Care expects to perform in fiscal year 2021. These statements take into account all events known at the time the financial statements were prepared which could affect the development of our business in 2021. BUSINESS POLICY Fresenius Medical Care is the worlds leading provider of prod- ucts and services for individuals with renal diseases based on publicly reported revenue and the number of patients treated. development of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The accelerat- ing effects of excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic are continuing into 2021. The further development significantly depends on the adoption and speed of the roll out of vaccina- tions to our worldwide patient population. Fresenius Medical Care expects to have a significant adverse annualization effect on treatment volumes. Some significant regional differences are likely to remain: The Company anticipates below average growth rates in the U.S., Japan and Western and Central Europe. The number of patients with chronic kidney disease is already relatively high in these countries and regions and patients gen- erally have reliable access to treatment, normally dialysis. In economically weaker regions we expect the growth rates partly to be considerably higher. We expect patient numbers to con- tinue growing in the coming years - See TaBLe 2.39. dialysis patients, which is expected to increase from around 3.7 M worldwide in 2020 to over 6 M in 2030.  Increase in lifestyle diseases: Diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes are on the rise around the world. They can cause damage to the entire organism and also often impair kidney function in the long-term.  Improved access to medical care: Thanks to ongoing efforts to establish and expand balanced and sustainable health care systems in many countries around the globe, a growing num- ber of patients are gaining access to suitable dialysis treat- ments for the first time. We expect this trend to continue and drive demand for high-quality products and treatments.  Changes in the health care industry: The health care industry is constantly changing. We believe that demand for the holis- tic care of chronic patients will continue to rise. In future, the We aim to further expand this position in the years ahead. Our focus when treating kidney patients will no longer be simply products and health care services are at the core of our strat- egy. To take it to the next level until 2025, we will concentrate on three key areas: the renal care continuum, critical care solu- tions, and complementary assets. Aspects of the renal care con- tinuum include new renal care models, value-based care, chronic kidney disease and transplantation, and future innovations. Over the next few years, we will use our competence in the crit- ical care business to address a variety of health challenges and continue to leverage our core competencies through partner- ships, investments, and acquisitions. This approach constitutes our commitment to long-term sustainable development and growth. We have no plans to make significant changes to our business policy. SECTOR-SPECIFIC ENVIRON- MENT - DIALYSIS MARKET The Company expects the number of dialysis patients world- wide to grow by about 3 % in 2021 depending on the further T 2.39 EXPECTED GROWTH IN PATIENT NUMBERS North America Segment EMEA Segment Asia-Pacific Segment Latin America Segment WORLDWIDE Growth 2021 0 % to 1 % ~ 2 % ~ 5 % ~ (2 %) ~ 3 % Source: Internal estimates. Our growth strategy is based on an in-depth analysis of the major trends affecting Fresenius Medical Care:  Demographic factors: Demographic factors are one of the main reasons for the continued growth of dialysis markets. As average life expectancy rises worldwide, the share of older people in the population is also growing. However, kid- ney function deteriorates with age. Therefore, demographic change is an important indicator for the future number of on offering individual dialysis products or services, but also on combining all fields of application related to dialysis and coordinating them more effectively. Hemodialysis will remain the treatment of choice, accounting for 88 % to 89 % of all dialysis therapies. Peritoneal dialysis will continue to be the preferred treatment for 11 % to 12 % of all dialysis patients. The volume of the worldwide dialysis market, which amounted to about 82 BN last year according to preliminary estimates, is expected to increase by around 1 % to 4 % per year. This is based on the assumption that exchange rates will remain stable in the forecasting period. The overall volume of the dialysis market could thus reach around 83 BN to 85 by 2021. In addition, the reimbursement and ancillary services utiliza- tion environment significantly influences our business. In the U.S., our biggest sales market, the reimbursements of govern- mental institutions are lower than the reimbursements of pri- vate insurers. Therefore, a change in the portion of reimburse- ments by private insurers in the U.S. influences our business. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS DEVELOPMENT OF FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE IN 2021 Fresenius Medical Cares outlook for 2021 is at Constant Exchange Rates. Outlook 2021 is inclusive of anticipated COVID- 19 effects and excluding special items. Special items include costs related to the FME25 program and effects that are unusual in nature and have not been foreseeable or not foreseeable in size or impact at the time of giving guidance. These targets are based on the following assumptions:  excess mortality of dialysis patients to continue to accumu- late in the first half of 2021  COVID-19-related additional costs to remain on high level  besides the extended suspension of the U.S. Medicare sequestration (until end of March 2021), no further public relief funding is assumed.

FME25: TRANSFORMING GLOBAL OPERATING MODEL TO STRENGTHEN PROFITABILITY To support its 2025 strategy, further strengthen profitability FINANCIAL TARGETS: 2020  2025 As part of the 2025 strategy, Fresenius Medical Care is aiming for growth rates (See CHaRT 2.42) over the next five years: Our business development will be materially affected by COVID- 19 in 2021. To support its 2025 strategy, further strengthen profitability and compensate for the negative earnings effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Fresenius Medical Care will launch its FME25 program. We confirm the 2025 targets that are based on the Company s mid-term strategy, and we are confident to take our next step towards achieving our goal of providing and compensate for the negative earnings effects of the COVID- health care for chronically and critically ill patients across the 19 pandemic, Fresenius Medical Care will launch its FME25 pro- gram. The program will focus on simplification of our operating model. This shall include streamlining and transforming our global operating model, applying learnings from the new nor- mal and accelerating the digitalization agenda. Until 2025 we C 2.42 OUR FINANCIAL TARGETS: GUIDANCE 2020  2025 1 renal care continuum. plan to invest up to 500 M in our FME25 program to sustain- ably reduce the cost base. We expect for each euro invested in FME25 to sustainably reduce the annual cost and minimally improve operating income by the same amount by 2025. 1 at constant currency excluding special items RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES REPORT As a company with global operations, we are naturally exposed to risks associated with our business activities. Ultimately, we can leverage opportunities for our business only if we are willing to take certain risks. Based on our many years of experience and our extensive knowledge of the markets, we are able to identify and assess risks and opportunities for our business. RISK AND OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT We see risk management as the ongoing task of determining, analyzing and evaluating the spectrum of actual and potential risks arising from our business operations in our environment and, where possible, taking pre-emptive and corrective mea- sures. Our risk management system provides us with a basis for these activities. It enables management to identify risks that could jeopardize our growth or going concern and to take steps to minimize any negative impact. Accordingly, it is an important component of our management and governance. In addition, we ensure our long-term success by actively man- aging opportunities. The aim here is to identify and assess opportunities as early as possible, and initiate appropriate measures so that opportunities can be turned into business success for Fresenius Medical Care. Long-term and medi- um-term opportunities are taken into account in our strategy and budget planning. We exploit opportunities that can be implemented at short notice as part of ongoing business operations, provided this is meaningful and in line with our business targets. RISK MANAGEMENT Risk management system The main objective of the risk management system is to iden- tify potential risks as early as possible to assess their impact on business activities and enable us, where necessary, to take appropriate countermeasures. Due to constantly changing external as well as internal requirements and conditions, our risk management system is continuously evolving. In the past financial year, the completeness and validity of risk information within our risk management approach as well as its effective- ness was strengthened by the introduction of a formal process regarding the effectiveness review of countermeasures for cer- tain risks as well as strengthening the interface between the compliance management system and the enterprise risk man- agement system. The organizational structure of our risk management as well as the previously described processes are shown in CHaRT 2.43 ON page 63. The structure of the internal risk management system is based on the internationally recognized framework for company-wide risk management, the Enterprise Risk Management - Inte- grated Framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organiza- tions of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Opportunities are not covered by the implemented risk management system. As part of the risk management system, regional risk coordina- tors assume the task of coordinating risk management activi- ties within the operating segments with the help of risk man- agement software. These activities relate to existing and potential emerging short-term as well as medium-term risks. Semi-annually, identified risk information is processed by the risk coordinators and discussed in regional / functional risk committees. Subsequently, the central risk management func- tion gathers the risks from regions and functions, analyses and discusses them in the corporate risk committee and communi- cates the compiled results to the Management Board. The focus during this process is on significant risks, which are above a defined threshold. The Management Board and the central risk management are promptly informed of new risks that are estimated to be high or develop into high risks in order to ensure appropriate responses. The effectiveness of the risk management system is monitored by the Audit and Corporate Governance Committee of the Supervisory Board. In addition to risk reporting, standard reporting to manage- ment is an important tool for managing and controlling risks, as well as for taking preventive measures in a timely manner. Therefore, our Management Board is informed on a monthly basis about the industry situation, our operating and non-oper- ating business, and the outcome of analyses of our earnings and financial position, as well as of the assets position on a quarterly basis. The Global Internal Audit department is regularly informed about the results of the risk management system. This depart- ment determines risk focus areas and audits a selected number of our departments, subsidiaries and IT applications worldwide each year. Determined risk focus areas are audited across all business segments. The department works according to the internationally accepted standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), which was confirmed by a quality assessment in 2017. The scope of internal auditing is widespread and involves, among other activities, periodic assessment of the effective- ness of controls (including legal compliance controls) over busi- ness processes, IT security, the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with accounting regulations and internal poli- cies. Our locations and units to be audited are determined annually on the basis of a selection model taking various risks into consideration. This annual audit plan is reviewed and approved by the Management Board and the Audit and Corpo- rate Governance Committee of the Supervisory Board. All audit reports with material observations are presented to the Man- agement Board. The Global Internal Audit department is also responsible for monitoring the implementation of measures mitigating identified deficiencies. The Management Board is informed about the mitigation status on a quarterly basis. The Audit and Corporate Governance Committee of the Super- visory Board is also informed of the audit results. In 2020 the Global Internal Audit department stopped onsite audits due to COVID-19 from March onwards and conducted all audits remote. A total of 40 audits were carried out. Risk focus areas were compliance, acquisitions and cybersecurity. Nevertheless, it is important to note that a functioning and adequate risk management system cannot guarantee that all risks are fully identified and controlled. Internal control and risk management system for the Groups accounting process Our internal control system over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Group financial state- ments are issued in accordance with appropriate accounting principles. Our internal reporting process is generally carried out at four levels and is designed for the reliable recording, pro- C 2.43 RISK REPORTING Reporting of consolidated risks Reporting of consolidated risks Reporting of reviewed risks cessing and control of financial data and key figures. At each of these four reporting levels - the local entity, the region, the seg- ment and the entire Group - the figures and data are compared regularly on a monthly and quarterly basis with the previous years values, budget targets, and the latest projections. In addition, the Management Board and the departments respon- sible for preparing the annual and consolidated financial state- ments discuss all parameters, assumptions and estimates that substantially affect the externally reported consolidated and segment results. The Audit and Corporate Governance Com- mittee of the Supervisory Board also reviews current quarterly results and compares them with budgets and projections. The internal control system contains guidelines and instruc- tions designed for the appropriate and accurate recording and presentation of Company transactions. Further control mechanisms aimed at achieving reliable finan- cial reporting and correct recording of transactions within the accounting and the consolidation process include automated and manual reconciliations, as well as the separation of certain personnel functions to prevent potential conflicts of interest. All process owners identify and assess the risks of their respec- tive processes in terms of the implications for accounting and financial reporting. These process owners also determine that corresponding controls are in place to minimize these risks. Changes to accounting standards are discussed on an ongoing basis and considered in the preparation of the financial state- ments. Employees responsible for financial reporting are pro- vided with regular training regarding changes in accounting standards. The consolidation is performed centrally by the department which is responsible for the group accounting. The basis for the consolidation is derived from reporting packages and sub-group consolidated financial statements prepared and submitted by local group entities. The preparation of reporting packages and sub-group consolidated financial statements is performed according to central requirements and guidelines. As we are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange, it is required to adhere to the requirements of the U.S. Sarbanes-Ox- ley Act (SOX). Section 404 of this federal law stipulates that the management boards of companies listed in the U.S. are responsible for implementing and adhering to an effective internal control system to produce reliable financial reporting. Based on this requirement, the design and operating effective- ness of the internal control system over financial reporting are routinely tested and considered in regular internal audits. These criteria are also included in the review by our indepen- dent registered public accounting firm. The internal control system over financial reporting follows the criteria of the COSO model, Internal Control - Integrated Frame- work (2013), which was developed by the Committee of Spon- soring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and is rec- ognized as a standard by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In accordance with the COSO model, the internal control system over financial reporting is divided into five components: control environment, risk assessment, con- trol activities, information and communication, as well as the monitoring of the internal control system. Each of these com- ponents is regularly documented, tested and assessed. We aligned our internal controls to fulfill the requirements of the COSO model. Our review of the internal control system over financial report- ing complies with a specific SEC guideline (Guidance Regarding Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting) and is conducted with software support. Initially, regional project teams coordinate the assessment of the inter- nal control system in each region, after which the results are consolidated for the whole Group. Based upon this assessment, management evaluates the effectiveness of the internal con- trol system for the current fiscal year. External advisers are consulted as needed. A corporate steering committee meets several times a year to review regulatory developments and changes of relevant internal control requirements, to discuss possible control deficiencies, and derive further measures. In addition, in its meetings, the Audit and Corporate Governance Committee of the Supervisory Board is informed regularly of the results of managements assessment. As of December 31, 2020, management assessed our internal control system over financial reporting and determined that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 is effective. Internal control systems over financial reporting are subject to inherent limitations, irrespective of how carefully these sys- tems are designed. As a result, there is no absolute assurance that financial reporting objectives can be met, nor that mis- statements will always be prevented or detected. Risks The following section describes significant risks which could have an impact on our business operations. In the course of the risk assessment an estimation of the risks takes place regard- ing the likelihood of occurrence and the potential impact in the respective assessment period, allowing a prioritization of the risks into the classifications low medium and high. Besides quantitative factors, especially qualitative factors are applied. For the identification of strategic developments, besides the short-term consideration (one year), risks can also be assessed in terms of a mid-term effect within the subse- quent five years. The scales for classification of potential impact and likelihood as well as the localization of the risks within the risk matrix are depicted in CHaRT 2.44 ON page 65. The risk areas as well as measures for mitigating the impact or the probability of occur- rence of risks within these areas are described in the following section. Sector-specific risks Regulatory environment, product quality Our operations in both health care services business and prod- ucts business are subject to extensive governmental regulation in virtually every country in which we operate. We are also sub- ject to other laws of general applicability, including anti-trust laws. The applicable regulations, which differ from country to country, cover areas that include:  the quality, safety and efficacy of medical and pharmaceuti- cal products and supplies;  regulatory approvals and oversight of clinical and certain non-clinical research and development activities;  product approvals and regulatory approvals for new prod- ucts or product improvements;  the operation and licensure of manufacturing facilities, labo- ratories, dialysis clinics, ambulatory surgery centers and other health care facilities;  audits and reviews by enforcement authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for compliance with applicable drug regulations;  product labeling, advertising and other promotion; C 2.44 RISKS WITH POTENTIAL SHORT-TERM EFFECT (ONE YEAR) AND MID-TERM EFFECT (FIVE YEARS) Risks with potential short-term effect (one year) 2 Risks with potential mid-term effect (five years) 2  accurate reporting and billing for government and third- party reimbursement including accurate and complete med- ical records to support such billing;  the discounting of reimbursed drug and medical device products and the reporting of drug prices to government authorities;  limits on our ability to make acquisitions or certain invest- ments and the terms of those transactions;  the collection, dissemination, access, use, security and pri- vacy of protected health information and other protected data;  compliance with due diligence, warranty obligations and product liability rules and  compensation of medical directors and other financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources. low medium major severe low medium major severe In addition to the risks from non-compliance with the regula- tory environment, as a manufacturing company we face the risk that products, as a result of unsuitable product designs or issues in the production process, do not fulfill our standards of quality and could lead to the possibility of not achieving expected treatment results which may result in product recalls that might lead to significant adverse financial results or repu- tational damage. If we fail to comply with one or more of these laws or regula- tions or incurs a quality incident, this may give rise to a number of adverse legal and financial consequences. These include, in particular, loss or suspension of governmental certifications, loss or suspension of licenses under the laws of governmental authority from which we generate substantial revenues, mone- tary and administrative penalties, recall actions and claims for RISK AREA 1 Regulatory environment 2 Quality 3 U.S. federal health care programs 4 Composition of our customer base 5 Reimbursement by private insurers 6 Health care reforms 7 Growth 8 Competitors 9 Research and development 10 Intellectual Property 11 Referral practices 12 Procurement low risk medium risk high risk 13 Personnel 14 Corruption and Fraud 15 Information systems and business processes 16 Liquidity and financing 17 Currencies and interests 18 Litigation and potential exposures 19 Taxes 20 International operations 21 Unpredictable events 22 Global economic conditions and disruptions in financial markets 23 COVID-19 damages, increased costs for compliance with government 1 Likelihood: unlikely: 0 to 10 %, possible: > 10 to 50 %, likely: > 50 to 90 %, almost certain: > 90 to 100 %. 2 Potential impact: low: small negative impact, medium: moderate negative impact, major: significant negative impact, severe: material negative impact. orders, complete or partial exclusion from government reim- bursement programs, refunds of payments received from gov- ernment payors and government health care program benefi- ciaries due to any failures to meet applicable requirements or complete or partial curtailment of our authority to conduct business. In the end, these types of risks could no longer be insured. Including the considerable costs of legal defense, all the consequences mentioned above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and finan- cial condition. A number of the health care businesses in the U.S., that the Company operates, is owned or managed by entities in which one or more hospitals, physicians or physician practice groups hold an interest. We also have arrangements with physician practices to collaborate on our value-based arrangements with public and private payors. While the Company has struc- tured its arrangements with physicians to comply with many of the criteria for safe harbor protection and waivers under the federal and state Anti-Kickback Statutes, its arrange- ments do not satisfy all elements of such safe harbor. If one or more of our arrangements, including value-based agreements were found to be in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Law, we could be required to restructure or termi- nate them. We also could be required to repay to Medicare, Medicaid as well as other federal health care amounts pursu- ant to any prohibited referrals, and we could be subject to monetary penalties and exclusion from federal and state health care programs. Imposition of any of these penalties could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Compliance programs implemented in the regions reduce the risk of legal violations by providing general and specific rules of conduct and procedures as well as regular training of the employees according to the specifications. To ensure that our products and services comply with the quality requirements, we implemented quality management systems in the different regions. The employees have access to procedures and work instructions to ensure that the applicable quality requirements are met. In addition, we conduct internal reviews of the produc- tion sites and clinics to monitor compliance with quality stan- dards of our products and services. Furthermore, our plants and hospitals are also subject to external reviews by the rele- vant supervisory authorities. U.S. federal health care programs As stated in the report in section Macroeconomic and sec- tor-specific environment of chapter Economic Report start- ing on page 38, our dialysis clinics in the US participate in the Quality Incentive Program (QIP) within the End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) prospective payment system (PPS). Payment reductions of up to 2 % of Medicare reimbursements based on previous years performance can be made if the quality stan- dards of the QIP are not met in the clinics. Should we fail to meet the QIPs minimum requirements to a greater extent, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Through our value-based agreements and risk products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for certain patients in return for fixed periodic payments from gov- ernmental and commercial insurers. We currently participate in the Comprehensive ESRD Care initiative of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as well as in remunera- tion agreements with insurers under which we receive fixed periodic payments to cover all, or a defined amount of treat- ment costs, for a defined population of patients (Details and detailed descriptions of the above mentioned and other pro- grams in which we participate can be found in the report in sec- tion Macroeconomic and sector-specific environment of chapter Economic Report starting on page 38). Under CMSs Comprehensive ESRD Care Model, dialysis provid- ers and physicians can form entities known as ESRD Seamless Care Organizations (ESCOs). ESCOs that achieve the programs minimum quality thresholds and generate reductions in CMSs cost of care above certain thresholds for the ESRD patients covered by the ESCO will receive a share of the cost savings. However, ESCOs may also owe payments to CMS if actual costs of care rise above set thresholds. The profitability in our value-based agreements and risk prod- ucts is dependent in part upon our ability to negotiate favor- able financial terms, to manage a patients care, to collabo- rate with our payer partners, to coordinate with other health care providers and to find cost efficient, medically appropri- ate sites of service for our patients. Any failure to do so would limit our ability to improve the quality of patient care and health outcomes and to reduce medically unnecessary costs, which could lead to poorer performance under value-based payment arrangements. The reserves that we establish in connection with the operation of our value-based arrangements and risk products as well as estimations of the amount of revenues from health care ser- vices that we recognize in a reporting period are based upon assumptions and judgments concerning a number of factors which are subject to uncertainties. Those factors include trends in health care costs, expenses, the complicated billing and col- lection process, complex and changing laws and regulations subject to interpretation, determination of primary and sec- ondary coverage and other factors. Additionally, collections, refunds and payor retractions may continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided. To the extent the actual claims experience is less favorable than estimated based on our underlying assumptions, the timing and amount of our recognition of revenues as well as future earnings could be adversely affected or incurred losses could increase. Although efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) have been unsuccessful, further efforts to repeal or revise the ACA, including pending litigation seeking to declare the ACA as unconstitutional, may affect the projects future prospects in ways we currently cannot quantify or predict. We have applied, and were accepted, for participation in CMS Comprehensive Kidney Care Contracting (CKCC) model. While those entities which were accepted have elected to participate in the imple- mentation period beginning on October 15, 2020, each entity will elect, prior to April 1, 2021, whether to continue its partici- pation at-risk beginning the first performance year. We do not yet know whether we and our partners will be able to deliver better health outcomes while lowering CMS costs. We cannot give any assurance that we will achieve the cost sav- ings required or contemplated by these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addi- tion, we may experience higher write-offs of Medicare deduct- ibles and other cost-sharing amounts due to secondary unin- sured and underinsured patients, resulting in an increase in uncollectible accounts. We mitigated the impact of the ESRD PPS and the other legis- lative initiatives referenced above with two broad measures. First, we work with medical directors and treating physicians to make clinical protocol changes used in treating patients consis- tent with the QIP and good clinical practices, and we negotiate pharmaceutical acquisition cost savings. In addition, we achieved greater efficiencies and better patient outcomes by introducing new initiatives to improve patient care upon initia- tion of dialysis, increase the percentage of patients using home therapies and achieve additional cost reductions in its clinics. Composition of our customer base Our health care product business and our dialysis services busi- ness differ across the regions in which we operate. In many cases, our products and services are paid, either directly or indirectly, by government institutions. We believe the risk of default from a government payor is generally low to moderate worldwide. On a country level, the payor base is characterized by distinct customer or payor groups which can range in vol- ume from a few customers to a considerable amount of cus- tomer types which have varying levels of risk associated with default or non-payment of receivables as well as risks for dependencies based upon the competition within low volume customer base environments. In certain cases, a resulting dependency on the payment behavior and decision-making of our business partners can affect the collectability of accounts receivable and can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our measures aim to mitigate these risks by actively negotiat- ing long-term contracts with major customers, targeted mar- keting activities, developing new product and pricing models as well as improving the quality of our services and products. Reimbursement by private insurers In the U.S. a portion of the dialysis treatments is reimbursed by private insurers and integrated care organizations; these reim- bursements are in general higher than the reimbursements of the public health care systems. As a result, the payments we receive from private payors contribute a substantial portion of our profit. In 2020, approximately 36 % of our consolidated Health Care revenues were attributable to private payors in the North America Segment. If these payors succeed in lowering reimbursement rates in the USA, change the extent or condi- tions of their networks or if the portion of reimbursements by private insurers in general drops, this could result in a signifi- cant reduction in our revenue and operating profit. As of Janu- ary 1, 2021, for the first time, all ESRD patients are eligible to enroll in Medicare Advantage plans. As a result, some patients with commercial coverage, may elect to move to Medicare Advantage plans which generally pay less than other commer- cial plans. In addition, the health care insurance industry is experiencing continuing consolidation among insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, including increasing buyer power and impacts on referral streams. This may have an adverse impact on our ability to negotiate favorable coverage terms and commercially reasonable rates with such insurers. We monitor the relationships with private health insurance companies continuously and try to hedge the business through long-term contracts to maintain profitability. A portion of our patients who are currently covered by private insurers may be unable to continue to pay the premiums and may become uninsured for dialysis services or elect to transi- tion to government funded reimbursement programs that reimburse us at lower rates for our services if legislative or reg- ulatory efforts to restrict or eliminate the charitable funding of patient insurance premiums are successful. Health care reforms A number of governments have been considering proposals to modify their current health care systems to improve quality of and access to health care and to control costs. Policy- makers in several countries are also considering reforms that could change the methodology used to reimburse providers of health care services. Furthermore, standards and regula- tions compulsory for providing dialysis service can be subject to extensive changes. In fiscal year 2020, we derived approximately 32 % of our worldwide revenue from Medicare and Medicaid reimburse- ments in the U.S. Consequently, changes in legislation or reim- bursement practices regarding e.g. the End-Stage Renal Dis- ease Prospective Payment System (ESRD PPS), the Physician Fee Schedule, the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, and the Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment System could influence the volume of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements for ser- vices provided and the insurance coverage. A decrease in reimbursement rates, covered services or changes to standards, regulations or state funding in countries in which the Group operates, especially significant changes in the U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs could reduce our rev- enue and profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In this context it might happen that the annually adjusted ESRD PPS rates may not provide fully compensating reimbursement for the services or products consumed during service. This especially refers to the reimbursement of pharmaceuticals depending on their status as outside of or as part of the bun- dled rate. Pharmaceuticals included within the bundled rate are subjected to increased reimbursement pressure. If we are unable to secure appropriate reimbursement arrangements for the pharmaceuticals we provide in our dialysis clinics, we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results. Further, an increased utilization of bundled pharmaceuticals or decreases in reimbursement for pharmaceuticals outside the bundled rate may result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In the U.S., the previous administration publicly announced its intention to pursue significant changes to existing health care insurance programs. Although that administrations efforts to repeal or replace ACA were unsuccessful and the current U.S. Administration has stated its intention to maintain and strengthen the ACA, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argu- ments in November 2020 regarding the constitutionality of the ACA. In addition, options to restructure the Medicare program in the direction of a defined-contribution, premium support model and to shift Medicaid funding to a block grant or per cap- ita arrangement, with greater flexibility for the states, are also being considered. In October of 2017, the U.S. administration discontinued making cost-sharing reduction (CSR) reimbursements to insurers, argu- ing that Congress had failed to appropriate funding for them. In response, many state departments of Insurance (DOIs) either allowed or required insurers to mitigate their losses by increas- ing the 2018 premiums on their ACA plans. Many insurers also mitigated the impact to themselves by silver loading, a prac- tice whereby the premiums for silver-level plans were increased to offset the loss of CSR payments. Silver loading may also have mitigated the impact of premium increases to some low-income consumers by increasing their premium tax credits. In 2019 and 2020, all states either permitted or required silver loading. In 2017, several insurers sued the U.S. federal government to rein- state CSR payments. While the Biden administration is expected to reinstate CSR reimbursements and to limit states access to waivers allowing silver loading, we cannot predict, the extent to which silver loading will continue or how the ongoing litigation over the U.S. federal governments obligation to pay the CSRs might be resolved. As a result, a reduction in the availability of insurance through such exchanges could reduce the number of our commercially insured patients and shift such patients to Medicare and Medicaid. Challenges of this nature could have significant effects on our businesses, both positive and negative, but the outcomes are impossible to predict. Risks relating to the Companys business Growth The health care industry experiences continuing consolidation particularly among health care providers. This development could adversely affect our ability to find suitable acquisition targets and to increase future growth and product sales. Addi- tionally, our ability to make future acquisitions as well as to develop our core dialysis and non-core business depends, in part, on the appropriate strategic target selection, the avail- ability of financial resources and the current restrictions imposed by competition laws as well as existing credit agree- ments. The integration of acquired businesses may cause prob- lems, e.g. by assuming unknown liabilities, underperformance subsequent to integration, associated requirements from com- petition authorities or non-compliant business practices not disclosed by the seller or not uncovered during due diligence. We also compete with other health care companies in seeking suitable acquisition targets and developing our core dialysis and non-core business. Any or all of these factors generally could have a material adverse effect on our future growth, including growth of our product sales. Competitors We face numerous competitors in both our health care services business and dialysis products business, some of which may possess substantial financial, marketing or research and devel- opment resources. Competition from new and existing compet- itors and especially new competitive developments and innova- tions in technology and care delivery models could materially adversely affect the future pricing and sale of our products and services. In particular, technological innovation has historically been a significant competitive factor in the dialysis products business. The introduction of new products or services by com- petitors could render one or more of our products or services less competitive or even obsolete, which could also affect our sales and distribution of pharmaceuticals for which, to some extent, we are obligated to make certain minimum annual roy- alty payments. To ensure our permanent competitiveness, we work closely together with physicians and scientists. Important technologi- cal and pharmaceutical innovations are intended to be quickly identified and further developed, if necessary also by adapting our business strategy. Moreover, we secure our competitive- ness by ongoing analyzes of our market environment as well as the regulatory framework. The market activity, especially our competitors products and newly launched dialysis-related products are thoroughly monitored. The cooperation between the various technical, medical and academic institutions within our company also ensures our competitiveness, which is finally further enhanced by our consequent conduction of programs devoted to cost saving and efficiency increase. Research and development The development of new products and therapies proposes a risk that the desired development goal will not be achieved or achieved significantly later than planned. Costly and extensive preclinical and clinical examinations are necessary until admis- sion. All products, packaging, applications and technologies are constantly and systematically monitored, tested and improved. We address potential risks in the area of research and develop- ment (R&D) by continually analyzing, evaluating and assessing whether the R&D projects fit into our overall strategy. As a ver- tically integrated company, we also benefit from direct contact with our patients and medical professionals. Due to this close proximity to the market, we have the potential to gather import- ant information to develop and offer products and therapies that meet the needs of our customers. Referral practices In providing services within our health care business, we depend upon patients choosing our health care facilities as the location for their care. Patients may select a facility based, in whole or in part, on the recommendation of their physician. Physicians and other clinicians typically consider a number of factors when recommending a particular dialysis facility, dialy- sis home program, pharmacy, physician practice, vascular sur- gery center or urgent care center to an ESRD patient, including, the quality of care, the competency of staff, convenient sched- uling, location and physical condition. Physicians may change their recommendations, which may result in the movement of new or existing patients to competing facilities, including facili- ties established by the physicians themselves. At most of our dialysis clinics and home programs, a relatively small number of physicians often account for the referral of all or a signifi- cant portion of the patient base. We have no ability to control these recommendations and referrals. If a significant number of physicians or other referral sources cease referring their patients to our facilities and home programs or stop purchas- ing or prescribing our dialysis products, this would reduce our health care revenue and could materially adversely affect our overall operations. Intellectual property One of the typical intellectual property risks faced by us is inad- equate protection of sensitive knowledge in the form of patents for technologies and products we developed This means that competitors could copy our products without incurring compa- rable development costs. Moreover, a loss of sensitive knowl- edge could occur due to industrial spying or insufficient employee-non-compete restrictions. In addition, we could infringe the patent of a competitor and thus be liable for dam- ages; this could result in a ban on us further selling the affected product. An inadequate protection of our intellectual property could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Procurement Our business is dependent on the reliable supply of several raw materials and finished components for production and service purposes. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials at times of limited availability of such materi- als, this could result in delays in production or loss of sales and hence have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Sim- ilarly, price increases by suppliers and the inability to access new products or technology could also adversely affect our results of operations. In certain necessary cases products are obtained from a sole supplier. A failure of such a supplier could adversely affect our ability to manufacture, distribute or sell our products in a timely or cost-effective manner. Due to the stringent regulations and requirements of regulatory agencies we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replace- ment sources. Our purchasing strategy is aimed at developing partnerships with strategic suppliers through long-term contracts and at the same time ensuring, where reasonably practicable, that we have at least two sources for all supply and price-critical pri- mary products (dual sourcing, multiple sourcing). To prevent loss of suppliers, we monitor our supplier relationships on a regular basis. Suppliers which are integral to our procurement functions are also subject to performance and risk analyses as well as continuous supply chain monitoring. Through constant market analyses, a demands-based design of supplier-relation- ships and -contracts, as well as the use of financial instruments, we seek to mitigate disruptive goods shortages and potential price increases and to provide access to new product and tech- nology developments. Personnel Our continued growth in the health care business will depend upon the ability to attract and retain skilled workforce, includ- ing highly skilled nurses and other medical personnel. Competi- tion for those employees is intense and shortages for these sought-after employees, such as nurses, or skilled engineers and research and development personnel, may increase our and recruiting costs and / or impair our reputation for produc- tion of technologically advanced products. Moreover, we con- sider that future success in the provider business depends on the ability to attract and retain qualified physicians to serve as employees of or consultants to our health care services busi- nesses. Our health care products business depends on the development of new products, technologies and treatment concepts to be competitive. Additionally, in recruiting, employ- ing and retaining personnel we may be exposed to increasing risks relating to various labor and staffing laws, legislative, union or other labor-related activities or changes. Further, these factors could impact the integration of acquired compa- nies into our operations, which could increase our costs, decrease our productivity and prevent us from realizing syner- gies from acquisitions. If we are unable to manage the risks mentioned, then our growth and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Corruption and fraud We operate many facilities and engages with other business associates to help it carry out its health care activities. In such a decentralized system, it is difficult to maintain the desired level of oversight and control over the thousands of persons employed by many affiliated companies and its business asso- ciates. Training, oversight and compliance programs cannot ensure protection from deliberate, reckless or inadvertent acts of employees or third-party intermediaries that violate our compliance policies or anti-corruption laws. Such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on results of operations or financial condition. Beginning in 2012, we received certain communications alleg- ing conduct in countries outside the United States that might violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or other anti-bribery laws. We conducted investigations with the assis- tance of outside counsel and, in a continuing dialogue, advised the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) about these investigations. The DOJ and the SEC also conducted their own investigations, in which we cooperated. In the course of this dialogue, we identified and reported to the DOJ and the SEC, and took remedial actions with respect to, conduct that resulted in the DOJ and the SEC seeking mone- tary penalties including disgorgement of profits and other rem- edies. This conduct revolved principally around our products business in countries outside the United States. On March 29, 2019, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ and a separate agreement with the SEC intended to resolve fully and finally the U.S. government allegations against us arising from the investigations. In 2015, we self-reported to the German prosecutor conduct with a potential nexus to Germany and continued to cooperate with government authorities in Germany in their review of the conduct that prompted our and United States government investigations. Since 2012, we have made and continue to make further signif- icant investments in our compliance and financial controls and in our compliance, legal and financial organizations. Our reme- dial actions included separation from those employees respon- sible for the above-mentioned conduct. We are dealing with post-FCPA review matters on various levels. We continue to be fully committed to compliance with the FCPA and other appli- cable anti-bribery laws. Further information on these investigations can be found in NOTe 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Information systems and business processes As we continue to grow and introduce more international oper- ations, our processes are increasingly complex. Accordingly, we are more and more dependent on information and communica- tion technologies and -systems to structure our processes and harmonize them between different regions. An insufficient design of those systems and business processes as well as insufficient resources could lead to non-availability of certain information, causing inefficient workflows, deficient internal and external communication and intransparencies regarding operations. A breakdown of these systems could temporarily lead to standstill of parts of our provider and product business and consequently cause heavy damages. Additionally, cyber-attacks or privacy and data breaches regarding both our internal systems as well as systems of third- party service providers could result in the misappropriation or compromise of sensitive information. We and our third-party service providers gather and handle sensitive personal infor- mation of our patients as well as financial data in many regions of the world and thus need to adhere to various data protection and privacy regulations. Increased reliance on, and utilization of, telemedicine for delivery of healthcare services could increase this risk. Any loss, impermissible use, access or disclo- sure of this sensitive information or non-compliance with data protection and privacy related laws, regulations and standards could threat our position in competition, our reputation as well as our ability to continue normal operations. In May 2020, our IT systems were attacked which resulted in certain patient data being illegally published in Serbia. We immediately filed a complaint against the unknown attackers with the public prosecutor in Germany and we have contacted the patients who were affected by the illegal data publication as well as other relevant regulatory agencies and stakeholders. Furthermore, we intensified our efforts to implement response measures, which include for example Network monitoring for suspicious activity, endpoint threat protection and improve- ments in the back-up and data loss recovery plans. There was no material impact to the financial condition and results of operations as a result of this attack. Using its Information Security Management System (ISMS), which is based on the internationally recognized security stan- dard ISO 27002, our security guidelines and processes are enhanced continuously. Business data is backed up regularly and disaster recovery plans, which are regularly tested and improved, are in place. We operate three data centers at geo-graphically separate locations to maximize the availability and data security of IT systems. A mirrored infrastructure that creates a copy of critical systems is in use. In general, we con- tinue to enhance our internal information and reporting sys- tems to ensure that their structure meets evolving needs. Furthermore, among others, company guidelines relating to data protection and privacy, which also regulate the assign- ment of access rights and third-party collaboration, must be considered, trainings for employees are conducted and gover- nance structures are continuously adapted. Compliance is monitored with controls including those relating to Section 404 of SOX. Operational and security audits are carried out every year both internally and by external auditors. The existing IT security architecture with different layers of security measures protects the systems in our data centers. The access to sensi- tive or critical data from outside of the secured data center net- works is protected by the usage of secure protocols and cryp- tographic measures. Besides that, annual penetration tests for applications with critical data (e.g. patient or personnel data) are conducted. Other risks Liquidity and financing The liquidity risk is defined as the risk that a company is poten- tially unable to meet its financial obligations or to fund other purposes. Our Management Board manages the liquidity of the Group by means of effective working capital and cash manage- ment as well as an anticipatory evaluation of refinancing alter- natives. Our Management believes that existing credit facili- ties, cash flow from operating activities and additional short-term borrowings are sufficient to meet our foreseeable demand for liquidity. Furthermore, inadequate indebtedness could jeopardize the successful execution of our business strategy, increase our vul- nerability to general adverse economic conditions as well as limit our ability to obtain necessary financing. At December 31, 2020 respectively December 31, 2019, the Group had financial debt and lease liabilities of 12.38 BN respectively 13.78 BN. Our credit agreements and notes include covenants that require maintaining certain financial ratios or meeting other financial tests. The covenants also restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur debt, pay dividends and other restricted pay- ments, create liens or make investments or acquisitions. The breach of any of the covenants could result in a default and acceleration of payments of the indebtedness, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We consider ourselves able to maintain the required financial ratios at present and in the near future. Currencies and interests We actively manage foreign currency and interest rate expo- sures that are part of our normal business activities. Risk man- agement procedures for foreign currencies and interest rate exposures are based on strategies defined and, if necessary, adapted in close cooperation with the Management Board, including, for example, guidelines that cover all steps and levels of the risk management process. They define responsibilities for the determination of risks, the careful use of financial instruments for hedging purposes and for accurate financial reporting. The use of derivative instruments is restricted to micro hedges which are used in order to hedge exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business. We do not enter into transactions for trading or other speculative purposes. We enter into transactions with banks, which generally have rat- ings in the A Category or better, as approved by the Manage- ment Board. The effectiveness of the hedging relationships of the hedging instruments and the hedged items is tested on a quarterly basis. We enter into derivatives, particularly interest rate swaps and to a certain extent, interest rate options to protect against the risk of rising interest rates. These interest rate derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have been entered into in order to effectively convert payments based on variable inter- est rates into payments at a fixed interest rate. At Decem- ber 31, 2020 no interest rate swaps were in place. At Decem- ber 31, 2019, the notional amount of the euro-denominated interest rate swaps in place was 0 M. Derivative foreign currency contracts are entered into for the purpose of limiting the exchange rate exposure from sales and purchases as well as lendings and borrowings between our subsidiaries located in different countries and reporting in different currencies. A large portion of the transaction exposures arise from sales of products from our subsidiaries in the euro region to other international business units. The aggregate notional amount of foreign currency hedge con- tracts as of December 31, 2020 was 1,672 M, primarily for hedging Euro exposure to the U.S. dollar and various other currencies. Economic hedges, which we use, are accounted for as recognized hedges in the consolidated financial state- ments, when necessary. The estimation and quantification of transaction risks from for- eign currencies is determined according to the statistical risk measure Cash Flow at Risk (CFaR). CFaR indicates the maxi- mum amount of a potential loss of the forecasted foreign exchange cash flow of the next twelve months that occurs with a probability of 95 %. As of December 31, 2020, our CFaR amounts to 59.6 M. Further information on market, default and liquidity risks is included in NOTe 23 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Litigation and other exposures Risks associated with investigations and litigations are contin- uously identified, assessed and reported within the Company. We are involved in various legal proceedings and investigations resulting from our business operations. A negative outcome of these legal proceedings or investigations leading to legal pro- ceedings could have an adverse impact on our financial condi- tion and results of operations. External legal consulting support is always used to defend us against risks associated with litigations. If necessary account- ing measures like accruals are used. For the matters in which we believe a loss is both reasonably possible and assessable, an estimate of the loss or range of loss exposure is provided in NOTe 22 of the notes to the consoli- dated financial statements. For other proceedings the Com- pany believes that the loss probability is remote and / or the loss or range of possible losses cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. For details on ongoing proceedings and further information on material legal risks to which we are exposed, reference is made to NOTe 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Taxes We are subject to ongoing tax audits in the U.S., Germany and other jurisdictions. We could potentially receive notices of unfa- vorable adjustments and disallowances in connection with cer- tain of these audits. If we are unsuccessful in contesting unfa- vorable determinations we could be required to make additional tax payments, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in the relevant reporting period. In general, tax-relevant issues are, as necessary, coordinated with internal tax experts regarding compliance with applicable tax laws. If necessary, statements and opinions by external con- sultants are obtained to minimize tax risks. International operations We operate dialysis clinics in around 50 countries and sells a range of equipment, products and services to customers in around 150 countries. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including but not limited to the following:  The economic and political situation in certain countries could deteriorate or become unstable.  We could face difficulties in enforcing and collecting accounts receivable under some countries legal systems.  Local regulations could restrict our ability to obtain a direct ownership interest in dialysis clinics or other operations.  Some countries or economic unions may impose charges or restrictions, such as local content requirements, which restrict the importation of our products.  Potential increases in tariffs and trade barriers could occur upon any withdrawal by the United States or other countries from unions, including the exit from major multilateral trade agreements or the imposition of retaliatory tariffs and other countermeasures in the wake of trade disputes.  We could experience transport delays or interruptions.  International growth and expansion into emerging markets could cause us difficulty due to greater regulatory barriers than in the United States or Western Europe, the necessity of adapting to new regulatory systems, and problems related to entering new markets with different economic, social, legal and political systems and conditions.  We may not prevail in competitive contract tenders. We conduct humanitarian-related business directly or indi- rectly in sanctioned countries. In case of violation of applicable economic sanctions or export controls laws and regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, which vary between jurisdictions and depend on the factual circumstances of the given violation, but could include criminal penalties, imprison- ment of responsible individuals, administrative or civil penal- ties, restricted access to certain markets and reputational harm, among others. Our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from deliberate, reckless or inadvertent acts of our employees or agents that contravene our compliance policies or violate applicable laws. Any one or more of these or other factors relevant to interna- tional operations could increase our costs, reduce revenues, or disrupt operations, with possible material adverse effects on our business and financial condition. Developments of this nature are continuously monitored and analyzed and response measures like the extension of local production capacities, the adaptation of product designs, orga- nizational changes and various others are set in place based on case by case decisions. Unpredictable events We operate dialysis facilities or manufacturing facilities in many regions of the world, with diverse geographic, societal and economic conditions. Events such as natural disasters, ter- rorist attacks, political instability, epidemics as well as other unforeseeable events, could affect our services and our ability to deliver in a limited time and place. Through forward-looking planning and prevention programs, trying to limit possible effects of such events already in advance. In addition, to maintain operations in the event of an onset and to reduce potential impact on our patients and the organization, we have spare capacity and safety stock of cer- tain resources as well as emergency and recovery plans in place. Residual risks are eventually covered when necessary and expedient by taking out insurance. Global economic conditions and disruptions in financial markets We are dependent on the conditions of the financial markets and the global economy. In order to pursue our business, we are reliant on capital, as are our renal product customers and commercial health care insurers. Limited or more expensive access to capital in the financial markets could adversely affect our business and profitability. Among other things, the potential decline in federal and state revenues may create additional pressures to contain or reduce reimbursements for our services from public payors around the world, including Medicare, Medicaid in the U.S. and other gov- ernment sponsored programs in the U.S. and other countries around the world. Job losses or increases in unemployment rates may result in a smaller percentage of our patients being covered by employer group health plans and a larger percentage being covered by lower paying government reimbursement programs. To the extent that public and private payors are negatively impacted by a decline in the economy, we may experience further pres- sure on commercial rates, a further slowdown in collections and a reduction in the amounts we expect to collect. These developments as well a devaluation of currencies and worsen- ing economic conditions, including inflationary cost increases in various markets in connection with deteriorating country credit ratings also increase the risk of a goodwill impairment, which could lead to a partial or total goodwill write-off in the affected cash generating units, or have a negative impact on our investments and external partnerships. In addition, these developments may have adverse effects in other risk areas like U.S. federal health care programs, health care reforms, reimbursement by private insurers, liquidity and financing, currencies and interest, as well as procurement and are reflected in the respective assessments. Any or all of the abovementioned factors, or other conse- quences of the continuation, or worsening, of domestic and global economic conditions which cannot currently be pre- dicted, could continue to have an adverse effect on our busi- nesses and results of operations. COVID-19 COVID-19 has resulted in a material deterioration of the condi- tions for the global economy and financial markets. The finan- cial impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition and results as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, has not been material. Going forward, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse impact on our operations, manufacturing, supply chains and distribution channels and increase our expenses, as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary mea- sures that we, our suppliers, customers and other businesses or governments implement or impose on a local, regional, national or international level. Given the already compromised health condition of typical dial- ysis patients, our patients represent a heightened at-risk popu- lation. Increased mortality rates in either the pre-end-stage renal disease patient population or in our ESRD patient popula- tion compared to the historical average are expected to mate- rially and adversely affect our operating results for 2021. Patients suffering from end-stage renal disease generally have co-morbidities which has resulted, and may continue to result, in more of our dialysis patients requiring hospitalization. Also, it appears that COVID-19 has resulted in an increase in persons experiencing temporary renal failure in many areas in which we operate, and we expect to continue to incur additional staffing costs required to meet the resulting increased demand for dial- ysis treatment and / or to provide equipment and medical staff needed for emergency treatments, for example in hospitals. We expect negative effects through 2021 and in the mid-term on our business depending mainly upon the adoption and speed of the rollout of vaccinations. Various governments in regions in which we operate have pro- vided economic assistance programs to address the conse- quences of the pandemic on companies and to support health- care providers and patients. In the U.S., the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) has been enacted to mitigate certain adverse financial impacts of the pandemic, including impacts in the health care sector. Addi- tional funding provided under the CARES Act and other COVID- 19 relief provides some financial support to our business in the U.S. through suspension of the 2 % Medicare payment seques- tration reduction from May 2020 to March 31, 2021, as well as through accelerated and advance payments of Medicare reim- bursement and grants to defray expenses and mitigate the loss of revenues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, these measures may not fully offset potential lost revenues and increased costs and we do not expect additional governmental assistance during 2021. Further legislation and amendments to existing legislation intended to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse eco- nomic consequences may be enacted in the markets in which we operate. As the COVID-19 pandemic is prolonged, the risk of further government intervention or measures to counteract the pandemic could impact our business globally. In addition, to the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, net assets, financial condition and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this report. Changes in the risk situation We operate in a constantly changing environment. Accordingly, the risk situation is also subject to constant change. Regarding the classification of single risks in terms of probabil- ity and potential impact, the following significant changes occurred compared to the previous year: One-year period: Since all major commercial payor contracts are under agree- ment for greater than one year, the risk from reimbursement by private insurers (5) has decreased to a low risk. The risk from health care reforms (6) is now considered a low risk, which is mainly a result of the decreased uncertainty with regards to reimbursements of Calcimimetics as they are now reimbursed at a fixed rate. The risks regarding Research & Development risk (9) as well as tax issues (19) were assessed for the first time from a short- term perspective and are considered a low and medium risk, respectively. The risk from global economic conditions (22) decreased to a low risk due to the write-off of goodwill for region Latin America. An assessment of potential adverse impacts on operational, financial and strategic objectives that result from the COVID-19 pandemic and taken countermeasures (23) resulted in a medium risk. Five-year period: Increasing competitor activities in the areas of home dialysis, managed care and digital services increase risk from competi- tors (8) to a medium risk. An assessment of potential adverse impacts on operational, financial and strategic objectives that result from the COVID-19 pandemic and taken countermeasures (23) resulted in a medium risk. OPPORTUNITIES MANAGEMENT Opportunities management system As much of our business is organized by region, we are able to identify industry-specific trends and requirements as well as the resultant opportunities in the different regions at an early stage and gear our actions to them. We also perform compre- hensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to enable us to capture business opportunities. This involves systematically evaluating relevant market data, closely examining research projects and taking general social trends into consideration. Our analyses focus on general economic, industry-specific, regional and local developments as well as regulatory changes. In addition, our Strategy and Planning departments and the managers of other divisions cooperate closely to allow us to identify global opportunities as early as possible. Opportunities As a vertically integrated dialysis company, Fresenius Medical Care can offer almost all of the products and services that seriously and chronically ill patients require across the renal care continuum. Our network of 4,092 dialysis clinics in around 50 countries is the largest of its kind in the world. As a result, we possess valuable dialysis expertise that is unique in the industry. Thanks to this wealth of experience, we know that high quality is not only the key to a better quality of life for patients, but can also make a significant contribution to reducing the costs of health care. In this context, we are rely- ing more than ever on digitization, which offers us new possi- bilities in kidney therapy, especially in the field of telemedi- cine and home dialysis. Numerous opportunities open up due to regenerative medicine, especially in the area of cell thera- pies, tissue engineering and transplants. Based on this under- standing and our business model, major opportunities arise that could have a positive impact on the results of operations, C 2.45 NUMBER OF DIALYSIS PATIENTS WORLDWIDE - FORECAST TO 2030 IN M 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Source: Internal estimates  Health care systems are under pressure to deliver ever more comprehensive medical care (longer life expectancy, increase in concomitant diseases, health care provision still being established).  Dialysis is a complex, life-sustaining procedure, which places high demands on health care systems in terms of expertise and efficiency. Therefore, public health care providers are increas- ingly collaborating with private providers to find solutions. Growing demand for holistic, value-oriented health care As a result of increasing cost pressure and the growing num- ber of patients, demand for holistic and value-based health care concepts for patients with chronic kidney failure is evolv- ing worldwide. Value-oriented models are changing the role of health care providers: In systems of this kind, we not only offer dialysis, but also take responsibility for the patients medical well-being beyond dialysis. financial position and net assets of Fresenius Medical Care as things stand today. Unless otherwise stated, the opportunities mentioned apply to all segments. Industry-specific opportunities Growth in patient numbers and demographic development The dialysis market is a growth market that is largely unaf- fected by common macroeconomic influences. According to estimates, the number of people worldwide suffering from chronic kidney failure and requiring dialysis treatment is rising at a rate of around 3 to 6 % annually. It is expected to reach around 3.8 M patients in 2021 and more than 6 M by 2030 (See CHaRT 2.45). Social trends play a role in this increase in patient numbers. In Europe and the U.S. in particular, they include the aging population and the increasing incidence of diabetes and hypertension, two illnesses that frequently precede the onset of chronic kidney failure. In developing and emerging countries, the growing population and steadily improved access to dialy- sis as a result of increasing wealth are key factors that further boost demand for dialysis products and services. We want to continue to make a significant contribution to meeting this demand in the future. Changes in legal and political conditions Whether private companies are allowed to offer dialysis treat- ment and in what form depends on a countrys health care sys- tem and its legal framework. For Fresenius Medical Care, oppor- tunities arise to tap into new markets or to expand its market share whenever a country opens up to private dialysis provid- ers. This decision is also increasingly influenced by the follow- ing factors: Value-based health care models help to deliver higher-quality treatment and better results at a lower cost. The aim here is to establish sustainable partnerships with payors around the world with the aim of driving forward the transition from fee- for-service payment to pay-for-performance models. We have supported this development from the start, because we know the needs of our dialysis patients best. We have com- bined the coordination of all aspects of medical care in our Care Coordination business. This encompasses all services that help us to offer our dialysis patients treatment across the renal care continuum. In 2019, the U.S. President signed an Executive Order on advancing kidney health. Among other things, it directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to develop new Medicare reimbursement models. One of these, the ESRD Treatment Choices Model (ETC Model), is mandatory and creates financial as well as other incentives for home dialysis treatments and kidney transplants. The final rule for the ETC Model was published in September 2020, comes into force in 2021, and provides fundamental opportunities for expanding home dialysis and kidney transplants, particularly in the U.S. Expansion of home dialysis If patient numbers grow as strongly as anticipated, cost pres- sure continues to rise and clinics reach full capacity, home therapies are expected to take on a more important role in dialysis, not only as a result of the ETC Model. This develop- ment could be advantageous for Fresenius Medical Care, as it presents us with growth opportunities. We offer a host of dif- ferent products and innovative solutions for home dialysis. By acquiring the U.S. company NxStage, which develops, pro- duces and markets dialysis machines and other products for home dialysis and intensive care, we have further expanded our home dialysis portfolio. Digital solutions in the field of telehealth and applications underpin our plans and are essen- tial to be able to offer this form of therapy to more people. We focus firmly on the needs of our patients by presenting them with the widest possible range of therapy options. This gives them the freedom to choose what form of treatment is cur- rently best for them. Self-determination is a key pillar of our vision to improve our patients quality of life. Opportunities related to our business operations New products and technologies Developing innovative products and technologies that deliver lasting added value for patients and remuneration systems right up until they are market-ready is another crucial factor in our long-term success. We advance dialysis-related innovations through our in-house research and development activities. In addition, we are able to enhance existing products ourselves and adapt them to the markets in which we operate. We will continue to add innovative products and technologies to our range in the future to capture growth opportunities and meet the demand for integrated care as effectively as possible. New forms of kidney therapy through digitalization Digitalization is a great opportunity for us. We aim to develop new forms of kidney therapy with the help of digital technolo- gies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and use of Big Data. In North America, for example, we collect over one terabyte of patient data every day to calculate risk models and forecast multiple treatment paths. This data enables us to assess the health of each patient more effectively. We can use the information not only to reduce negative outcomes for patients, but also to make costs, clinical workflows, production and development processes more efficient. COVID-19 in particular has prompted a significant acceleration in the implementation of digital projects in telehealth and inte- grated health care. They are key to our ability to increase the share of home dialysis. We have already taken important steps with Kinexus, a digital solution that comprehensively connects our devices and our digital hubs for patients, providers and care teams. In addition, we are digitalizing numerous business processes to provide even better support for those working from home. This offers us greater flexibility at a lower cost. Disruptive treatment options through regenerative medicine We are investing in promising technologies and research approaches in the field of regenerative medicine, which we hope will present us with new, increasingly disruptive treat- ment options in the long term. The focus here is on cell thera- pies, tissue engineering and transplants. As a result of our investment in Humacyte, we expect our patients to have fewer complications, infections and surgical procedures. Humacyte grows blood vessels from donated mus- cle cells in a bioreactor. Depending on the results of research trials, these blood vessels could provide safer and more stable vascular access and reduce catheter contact time for hemodi- alysis patients in the future. Beyond its use for dialysis access, the human acellular vessel (HAV) is also promising for treating peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and traumas. Fresenius Medical Care holds further participations in the field of regenerative medicine through Unicyte AG and Fresenius Medical Care Ventures GmbH. These have enabled us to expand our range of treatments in this area, particularly in early phases of chronic kidney disease. In addition, we have made substantial progress in the field of transplants through eGenesis, a company that has developed a multiplex platform based on the CRISPR / Cas9 technology. We expect this approach to enable safe and effective xenotransplantation, e.g. from pigs to humans. Thanks to our extensive commitment to regenerative medicine, our aim is not only to provide state-of-the-art options for renal replacement in the future, but also to substitute the function of other organs. We are confident that patients with diabetes or cardiovascular diseases can also benefit from our innovative and transformative therapies. Growing demand for critical care solutions The number of patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy to treat acute kidney failure is set to rise to 1.6 M per year by 2030. Fresenius Medical Care will expand its acute care portfolio to include other extracorporeal critical care therapy areas, such as the treatment of acute heart, lung and multi- organ failure. Investments and complementary assets We generate ideas for growth initiatives from market analyses and assess them as part of our annual budget planning, or more frequently if necessary. We manage the investments required for implementing projects using a detailed coordina- tion and evaluation process. The Management Board sets the investment budget for the Group as well as the focus of invest- ment. Before realizing investment projects, an internal commit- tee examines the individual projects and measures, taking into account their yield requirements and potential return on invest- ment. Projects are undertaken only if they help to increase the Companys value. We will supplement and strengthen our existing network where feasible through additional partnerships, investments and acquisitions in the field of research and development. This will help us to create added medical value while saving costs. The close collaboration between our Strategy and Planning depart- ments and the managers responsible for our acquisitions means that we can identify suitable potential purchases world- wide at an early stage. It will allow us to build an even stronger and more resilient foundation for our future growth to 2025 and beyond. Internal organization and procedures Fresenius Medical Care benefits from a number of long-term opportunities in the way it is organized and designs its business operations. For example, all production sites follow the lean manufacturing approach. In North America and at our Schwein- furt plant, this includes the Lean Six Sigma management sys- tem. The focus of lean manufacturing and Lean Six Sigma is on continuously improving manufacturing processes to achieve a low defect rate and, consequently, better product quality while reducing manufacturing times. In addition, constantly improv- ing business processes and rigorously optimizing cost struc- tures will allow Fresenius Medical Care to become even more profitable and competitive. Thanks to its global efficiency pro- gram, the Company has brought about a continuous and sus- tainable increase in efficiency. Sustainability To identify, assess and capture the opportunities associated with sustainability, Fresenius Medical Care continuously ana- lyzes key economic, social and environmental issues. In doing so, we look at the entire value chain of our business activities. Developing an effective global sustainability management sys- tem is an opportunity for us to embed sustainability in our busi- ness activities systematically and structurally. Our sustainabil- ity management system helps us to maintain our reputation and acceptance in society and to meet increased demand for sustainability in our business operations from key interest groups. This results in further opportunities for Fresenius Medical Care to position itself as a reliable, efficient partner and an attractive employer. Fresenius Medical Cares business model Our business model itself also provides opportunities for Fresenius Medical Cares future growth. As a vertically inte- grated dialysis company, we not only offer almost all of the products and services that a patient with chronic kidney failure requires for treatment, but also use these on a daily basis in our own clinics. As a result, we can incorporate the feedback from our patients, physicians and nurses worldwide in developing and manufacturing new products as well as in organizing our clinic management. This gives us a crucial competitive edge. ASSESSMENT OF THE OVERALL RISK POSITION AND THE OPPORTUNITIES BY THE MANAGEMENT Our risk management system forms the basis for assessing over- all risk. The overall risk position of Fresenius Medical Care is determined by the individual risks described above. Changes in the Groups risk situation compared to the previous year occurred as stated in the paragraph of the same name starting on page 74. As far as we are aware, there are currently no risks that could endanger the continued existence of Fresenius Medi- cal Care. In the course of the Company-wide review as part of the integrated management system, we also monitor the effective- ness of the implemented risk management system and make improvements where necessary. The Management Board will continue to expand our risk management as well as the review of the associated management system to be able to identify, exam- ine and evaluate potential risks even more quickly and initiate appropriate countermeasures. We believe that we have taken all necessary organizational steps to recognize potential risks early on and to respond to them appropriately. We furthermore remain confident that our integrated global business model and our earning power provide us with a sound basis for our business development, allowing us to capture the opportunities arising for the Company. In view of our leading position in the dialysis market, our innovative strength, our ded- icated staff and our structured processes for identifying risks early on and managing opportunities, we are convinced that we can continue to make the most of any opportunities that arise for our business in a responsible manner in the future.

The Compensation Report is an appendix of the group management report and is part of Fresenius Medical Cares group management report. TAKEOVER-RELATED DISCLOSURES Share capital held by the Companys shareholders as of December 31, 2020, totals approximately 293 M, divided into 292,876,570 non-par bearer shares, and a nominal value of 1 each. On the basis of the authorization granted by the Compa- nys annual general meeting on May 12, 2011 to conduct a share buyback program, the Company repurchased 7,548,951 of its own shares during financial year 2013. The Company redeemed 6,549,000 of these repurchased shares on February 16, 2016. On the basis of the authorization granted by the Companys annual general meeting on May 12, 2016 to conduct a share buyback program, the Company repurchased further 660,000 of its shares from December 11, 2017 up to and including Decem- ber 21, 2017, and further 431,000 of its shares from May 28, 2018 up to and including June 8, 2018. The Company redeemed the 1,091,000 shares repurchased in 2017 and 2018 on Decem- ber 12, 2018. In the period from March 12, 2019 up to and includ- ing May 10, 2019, the Company repurchased further 3,770,772 shares for an average weighted stock price of 71.55 on the basis of the authorization granted by the Companys annual general meeting on May 12, 2016. The Company redeemed the 3,770,772 shares repurchased in the period from March 12, 2019 up to and including May 10, 2019 on June 28, 2019. On the basis of the authorization granted by the Companys annual general meeting on May 12, 2016 to conduct a share buyback program, the Company repurchased further 10,795,151 shares for an aver- age weighted stock price of 63.50 per share in the period from June 17, 2019 up to and including April 1, 2020. On Decem- ber 10, 2020, the Company redeemed these 10,795,151 treasury shares together with the remaining 999,951 shares repur- chased pursuant to the share buyback program in 2013 for the purpose of capital reduction. Thus, as of December 31, 2020, the Company does not hold any treasury shares. The treasury shares were acquired in the course of share buyback programs on the stock exchange via the XETRA trading system and / or - for the share buyback program since June 17, 2019 - via selected multilateral trading facilities (MTF). The rights of the shareholders are governed by the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the Companys Articles of Association. This stipulates that each share shall be entitled to one vote at the Companys annual general meeting. The General Partner, Fresenius Medical Care Management AG, is responsible for managing and representing the Company. It does not participate in the profit or loss or the net assets of the Company. The General Partners management authority also encompasses exceptional management measures which do not require the approval of the shareholders. Vis-a-vis the General Partner, the Company is represented by its Supervisory Board. The General Partner will cease to be General Partner of the Company if and when all shares in the General Partner entity are no longer held directly or indirectly by one party, which at the same time must hold, directly or indirectly by means of con- trolled company as defined in Section 17 (1) AktG, more than 25 % of the Companys share capital. This does not apply if all the shares of the General Partner entity are held directly or indirectly by the Company. Additionally, the General Partner will cease to be the Companys General Partner if the shares in the General Partner entity are acquired by another person.  Who does not at the same time acquire shares of the Com- pany in the amount of more than 25 % of the Companys share capital, or  Who has not, within three months after the effectiveness of such an acquisition, submitted and voluntary or mandatory takeover offer to the Companys shareholders according to the rules of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (WpUG); the fair consideration offered to the sharehold- ers must also reflect the consideration which the purchaser pays for the shares in the General Partner entity, if the amount for such consideration exceeds the amount of its equity capital. The other grounds for withdrawal as provided by the law remain unaffected with respect to the General Partner. As of December 31, 2020, Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA, Bad Hom- burg v. d. Hohe, Germany holds 94,380,382 shares of the Com- pany, which corresponds to a 32.23 % holding and hence exceeds 10 % of the Companys total share capital. The appointment and removal of members of the Management Board of the General Partner entity are governed by Sections 84 and 85 AktG. Changes to the Articles of Association of the Company must be made in accordance with Section 278 (3) No. 179 in conjunction with Section 133 AktG. The Articles of Association entitle the Companys Supervisory Board to make amendments to the Articles of Association which concern only its working without resolution of the general meeting. The General Partner is entitled, subject to approval by the Supervisory Board, to increase the Companys share capital as follows in accordance with the resolutions passed by the share- holders at the annual general meeting:  Authorization to increase on one or more occasions up to August 26, 2025 the Companys share capital by up to a total of 35 M by issuing new bearer ordinary shares in return for cash contributions (Authorized Capital 2020/I).  Authorization to increase on one or more occasions up to August 26, 2025 the Companys share capital by up to a total of 25 M by issuing new bearer ordinary shares in return for cash contributions and / or investment in kind (Authorized Capital 2020/II). In both cases, the General Partner is entitled, with the approval of the Supervisory Board and in accordance with the resolu- tions passed at the general meeting, to take a decision on the exclusion of shareholders pre-emption rights. In addition, share capital shall be subject to a conditional increase of up to 9.494 M. This conditional capital increase will only be carried out to the extent that options were issued in accordance with the Stock Option Plan 2011 based on the shareholders resolutions of May 12, 2011 and May 12, 2016, pro- vided the holders of such options exercises their rights and the Company does not issue any of its own treasury shares to settle those options. With regard to options issued to members of the Management Board of the General Partner entity, the Supervi- sory Board of that entity shall be responsible. In accordance with the resolution taken at the annual general meeting on May 12, 2016, the General Partner is authorized to acquire treasury shares until May 11, 2021 and up to a maximum of 10 % of the share capital in place on the date of the resolu- tion. At no stage shall the acquired shares together with the treasury shares held by the Company or attributable to it pur- suant to Sections 71a ff. AktG exceed 10 % of the Companys share capital. The acquisition can be made via the stock exchange or by means of a public invitation to submit offers for sale. The authorization may not be used for the purposes of trading in its own shares. The General Partner is authorized to use the shares of the Company acquired on the basis of this or an earlier authorization for all legally admissible purposes, in particular also (i) to withdraw them from circulation without any requirement for a further resolution to be taken at the annual general meeting, (ii) to sell them to third parties in return for contributions in kind, (iii) rather than using condi- tional capital, to award them to employees of the Company and its affiliates (including to members of the executive manage- ments of affiliates) and to use them to service rights or com- mitments to acquire shares of the Company, and (iv) to service bonds with option or conversation rights issued by the Com- pany or by dependent companies as defined by Section 17 AktG. Under certain circumstances, a change of control resulting from a takeover offer could impact several of the Companys long-term financing arrangements which include market stan- dard change of control clauses. These clauses give creditors the right to call for early repayment of outstanding amounts in the event of a change of control. However, with regard to most of these financing agreements - in particular in case of bonds placed on the capital markets - this right to terminate only exists if the change of control involves the Companys rating or the corresponding financing instrument being downgraded.

SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY At Fresenius Medical Care, our patients are at the heart of everything we do. This also determines the way we look at sus- tainability. Our commitment to sustainability is incorporated in our vision and our mission. It is also reflected in our strategy to deliver sustainable solutions with innovative products and ser- vices of the highest quality at a reliable cost. Our long-term focus is on activities that support our mission to provide the best possible care for a growing number of patients in diverse health care systems. Managing sustainability successfully means creating lasting value  economically, ecologically and socially. For us, it also means continuously implementing global sustainability stan- dards in our operations around the world. To further drive the integration of sustainability in our business, we have launched a Global Sustainability Program. With the program, we commit ourselves to implementing global sustainability standards, measuring our performance, and developing global targets. The program provides us with a basis for further analyzing our global impact, identifying areas for improvement, and leverag- ing opportunities related to sustainability. More information on our Strategy 2025 can be found in the Group Management Report starting on page 22. GLOBAL TARGETS Our Global Sustainability Program reflects the growing require- ments for sustainability management and our commitment to continuously improve our performance. It defines global tar- gets for eight focus areas in the period from 2020 to 2022. These are derived from the results of our materiality analysis that we carry out to identify the most relevant sustainability topics for our business. The eight focus areas are: patients, employees, anti-corruption and bribery, data protection and privacy, labor and human rights, sustainable supply, environ- ment, and occupational health and safety. The overall objective of the program is to establish common global standards, goals, responsibilities, and key performance indicators (KPI) for our sustainability performance. Cooperation between all regions and global functions and the exchange of best practices are key success factors of our Global Sustainability Program. We want to leverage our scale and expertise and take regional needs into account in our sustain- ability activities. In 2020, as part of the Global Sustainability Program, we approved new global policies in the areas of patient care, human and labor rights, and supplier manage- ment. We also defined global performance indicators for vari- ous areas of the program to measure our sustainability perfor- mance. For example, we introduced new global key performance indicators relating to patient surveys, product quality, and sus- tainable supply. In the year under review, we also stepped up internal communi- cation on our sustainability activities and the targets of the sustainability program to raise awareness among employees. In addition, we communicated the progress and results of our Global Sustainability Program externally to increase transpar- ency for our stakeholders. The progress of the Global Sustainability Program is incorpo- rated in the Management Boards compensation in the form of sustainability targets. More information on sustainability in the compensation system can be found in the Group Management Report starting on page 124. For further information on policies and commitments, please see our website (www.freseniusmedicalcare.com/en/ about-us/sustainability). MATERIAL TOPICS We regularly evaluate the relevance of sustainability topics for our business. In 2019, we conducted a comprehensive material- ity analysis to identify and prioritize topics that matter most to our business and have the strongest impact on sustainability aspects. We selected and clustered topics from a list of more than 100 topics. The long list of topics was based on insights from various sources. These include our corporate risk man- agement, Environment Social Governance (ESG) ratings and rankings, international sustainability reporting standards, including those of GRI and the Sustainability Accounting Stan- dards Board (SASB), and competitor benchmarks. The list also included the results of our trend and media analysis. To priori- tize topics, we involved internal stakeholders from the different regions and functions and reviewed the outcomes with selected external experts. In 2020, we reviewed our materiality analysis. It confirmed the prioritization of key areas identified in 2019. We continuously monitor and evaluate upcoming topics and areas of interest for our stakeholders. SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE The highest governing body for sustainability issues is our Sus- tainability Decision Board. Headed by CEO Rice Powell, it is responsible for integrating sustainability into the Companys strategy and business. Together with the Sustainability Deci- sion Board, the Management Board decides on strategic initia- tives. In 2020, for example, the Sustainability Decision Board approved the implementation of the Global Supplier Code of Conduct and three global policies that are relevant for our sus- tainability performance. The Management Board and the Supervisory Board review the progress of sustainability man- agement, which is then published in the separate non-financial group report. Two further committees support our decision-making pro- cesses for sustainability initiatives. The Corporate Sustainabil- ity Committee is an advisory and steering body for global sus- tainability activities. It is comprised of senior representatives nominated by the Management Board to represent regional and functional interests in our sustainability efforts. The Risk Committee analyzes and discusses sustainability risks as part of our corporate risk management. The results are compiled twice a year and communicated to the Management Board. Strategic sustainability activities for the Company are driven by the Global Sustainability department. It manages the Com- panys Global Sustainability Program in close cooperation with the regions and functions. The Global Head of Sustainability regularly informs the Management Board about the progress of the program and the status of target achievement. The Global Head of Sustainability also participates in Fresenius SE & Co. KGaAs Group Sustainability Board to discuss sustainability activities and share best practices with experts from other business units of the holding. RISK MANAGEMENT We monitor and assess non-financial risks as part of our corpo- rate risk management. The assessment is based on a list of potential sustainability risks, which is regularly reviewed. In accordance with the German Commercial Code, we are required to report on known significant risks related to our own opera- tions, business relationships, products, or services that are very likely to have an adverse effect on material non-financial topics. We did not identify any material non-financial risks of this kind in 2020. In the reporting year, we also performed global risk assess- ments on our supply chain as well as on environmental protec- tion and human and labor rights. With the help of external plat- forms, we looked at country and industry-specific risks for the topics in question, among others. More information on our corporate risk management can be found in the Group Management Report starting on page 62. For information on our environmental risk assessments, see the section Environmental protection starting on page 97. More information on our risk assessment on human and labor rights can be found in the Human rights section starting on page 96, and our supply chain risk assessment below. STAKEHOLDER INCLUSION As a company with global operations, our business activities have an impact on many stakeholder groups. These include patients, employees, shareholders, suppliers and the communi- ties in which we work. Representatives from academia, politics, media and international organizations are also important inter- est groups. Engaging in dialog with relevant stakeholders is essential to understand their expectations of our company. It is also part of building trust and reliable partnerships and helps us to share knowledge and promote scientific progress. In the year under review, we participated in several expert groups such as Kidney Care Partners and the National Quality Forum. Furthermore, we joined technical expert panels for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal public health care authority in the U.S. We are subject to a wide range of complex legislative and regu- latory processes that affect our business. Therefore, we period- ically engage in policy discussions and collaborate with third parties to assist in lobbying efforts. Our principles relating to our political activities are stated in our Code of Ethics and Busi- ness Conduct (Code). They provide the basis for our political dialog in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These principles also apply to our interactions with associa- tions. In 2020, we were involved, for example, in the German Employers Association and participated in the International Labour Organizations (ILO) Corporate Social Responsibility working group. Furthermore, Fresenius Medical Care is a mem- ber of the International Organization of Employers (IOE) and the Global Industrial Relations Network (GIRN). More information on our collaboration with external research and innovation partners can be found in the Group Manage- ment Report starting on page 34. For information about our dialog with employee representatives, see the Employees section starting on page 88. SUSTAINABILITY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN As a global health care company, we understand the responsi- bilities that relate to the management of a complex supply chain worldwide. We have established policies and procedures to comply with applicable laws and with our own standards in each country we do business in. Our principles for responsible procurement reflect our commitment to promoting sustainable business practices in our daily operations. We expect our sup- pliers to comply with our sustainability requirements and to share our commitment to sustainability throughout their sup- ply chain. We aim to cooperate with suppliers on sustainability with the objective to increase transparency on the environmental and social impact associated with our supply chains. In 2020, we launched our Global Supplier Code of Conduct, which replaces the previously used Sustainability Principles. Our Global Sup- plier Code of Conduct further specifies our expectations to suppliers. It covers the areas of integrity and ethics, human rights and labor conditions, quality, occupational health and safety, and environmental protection. We are gradually inte- grating it into our contracts with suppliers and our internal guidelines and processes. In 2020, we informed strategic sup- pliers about the new Global Supplier Code of Conduct and the standards it sets. More than 260 employees in procurement, as well as colleagues from departments such as Legal, Finance, and Compliance, participated in internal training courses on the Supplier Code of Conduct. Training will continue in 2021 and beyond. In our vertically integrated organization, responsibility for pro- curement is shared between our manufacturing business and our health care services business as well as headquarters. The respective procurement departments are responsible for over- seeing the implementation of our Global Supplier Code of Con- duct. The procurement departments for our manufacturing and our health care services business have a direct reporting line to the Management Board. They are working on strength- ening sustainable supply chain management in cooperation with the Companys Global Sustainability department. In the context of our Global Sustainability Program, we launched an initiative to evaluate suppliers based on sustainability risks. This helps us to cluster our supplier base according to their sustainability risks, monitor them more closely and take corre- sponding action. Critical suppliers will be asked to provide information about their sustainability performance, for instance in the form of a self-assessment. We will use this to identify suppliers we want to work with in order to ensure com- pliance with our sustainability standards. We have also started to monitor social media releases regarding our suppliers to expose potential issues. By the end of 2020, we had screened the social media presence of more than 20 % of our most important suppliers by relevant spend. In 2020, we set ourselves targets to further promote sustain- ability in the supply chain. As a next step, we are planning to roll out a global e-learning course on sustainable supplier man- agement with the goal of reaching our procurement staff in all countries by the end of 2022. RESPONSIBILITY FOR PATIENTS Our patients well-being is our top priority and key to the Companys success. We are committed to delivering safe, high-quality care for patients with chronic illnesses. To live up to our commitment, we continuously monitor and analyze the quality performance of our products and services. We also measure patient satisfaction and take our patients feedback into account to improve our services. We are continu- ously working to expand access to high-quality health care for more patients and further improve the care we offer. This also involves investing in innovations and new technologies, and leveraging insights from scientific research and collaboration with partners. In 2019, we established the Global Medical Office to coordinate our efforts to advance medical science and patient care. It is part of a network that drives scientific and medical progress worldwide. The Global Medical Office is led by our Global Chief Medical Officer, who was appointed to the Management Board in 2020. Key findings of the Global Medical Office are published on a regular basis. IMPROVING QUALITY OF CARE Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct includes our commit- ment to continuously improve the quality of care for patients. We measure patients feedback using patient experience sur- veys as part of our global patient experience program. Overall responsibility for these surveys lies with specialized regional teams in cooperation with the Global Medical Office, which pro- vides global guidance. We conduct patient experience surveys at least every other year. The survey results are reviewed to identify strengths as well as opportunities. Our aim is to derive measures to enable more personalized care and improve the quality of our services. In 2020, we developed a global policy on patient care, including a chapter dedicated to patient experience surveys and related processes that are harmonized worldwide. Our main goal in doing so is to include our patients feedback to a greater extent. To achieve this, we have set ourselves targets. In 2021, we are planning to further roll out our harmonized patient experience survey worldwide. We also want to implement a globally consis- tent process for making improvements in all countries in which the patient survey is rolled out. We measure patient experience and customer loyalty using the Net Promoter Score (NPS). The NPS reflects the custom- er's overall satisfaction with our services. In 2020, our NPS was 67. By learning about our patients willingness to recom- mend Fresenius Medical Care, we can compare the services provided by our clinics and turn insights into action. As part of calculating the NPS, we measure the percentage of patient recommendations. In the reporting year, 75 % of our patients answered that they would highly recommend our services to a friend. In addition to the NPS, we track survey coverage and response rates. TaBLe 3.1 shows the results of measuring patient experience and customer loyalty with surveys. Grievance mechanisms are another way to get patients feed- back and understand their needs. We have established patient grievance processes in all regions to address topics raised by our patients in a timely manner. In 2020, we harmonized the patient grievance process globally. This is included in a dedi- cated chapter of the patient care global policy. We offer our patients various channels through which they can express their T 3.1 MEASURING PATIENT EXPERIENCE AND CUSTOMER LOYALTY WITH SURVEYS Net Promoter Score 1 Coverage 2 (%) Response rate 3 (%) 2020 67 78 76 1 The Net Promoter Score is a value between -100 and 100. It measures the patient experience of patients treated in Fresenius Medical Care dialysis clinics. 2 The coverage rate corresponds to the rate of eligible patients responding to the patient experi- ence survey. 3 The response rate is the rate of eligible patients that effectively answered the survey (incl. the question relating to the NPS). suggestions and concerns, such as dedicated hotlines and email addresses, complaint and suggestion boxes as well as a web form on our website. Patients and their representatives have the option to raise suggestions and concerns anony- mously. Our policies ensure that grievances can be filed with- out fear of reprisal or denial of services. The quality of care provided in our dialysis clinics is continu- ously measured and assessed based on generally recognized quality standards and international guidelines. These include the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) foundation, the Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (KDOQI), the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) guidelines as well as industry-specific clinical benchmarks and our own quality targets. We also evaluate a set of medical indicators on an ongoing basis to measure the quality of care provided in our clinics. We are currently harmonizing the quality reporting around kidney care to better understand geographic differences. TaBLe 3.2 ON page 85 shows the quality parameters by operat- ing segment. T 3.2 QUALITY PARAMETERS BY OPERATING SEGMENT 1 Re LaTINg TO THe FOURTH QUaRTe R OF THe ReSpeCTIVe YeaR Description Possible impact North America Europe, Middle East and Africa Latin America Asia-Pacific 1 The numbers for 2020 are based on quality parameters of 90 % of our dialysis clinics worldwide. This includes 80 % of our clinics in EMEA and 46 % of our clinics in Asia-Pacific. 2 Kt / V provides information about the effectiveness and efficiency of dialysis. 3 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines. 4 The hemoglobin value in patients blood should be kept within a defined range. Hemoglobin is the component of red blood cells that transports oxygen within the human body. An insufficient level of hemoglobin in the blood indicates anemia. 5 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes and European Renal Best Practice guidelines. 6 EMEA data includes patients with Hb > 12 g / dl without erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). 7 Certified reference material for human albumin based on specifications from Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (#ERM-DA470k) was obtained to ensure consistent results over time. 8 Calcium, albumin, and phosphate levels in the blood are indicative of a patients general nutritional status and point to disorders in the mineral and bone metabolism of patients with chronic kidney disease. 9 Phosphate specified as mg / dl of phosphorus. 10 Catheters are associated with a serious risk of infection and an increase in the number of days spent in hospital. Fresenius Medical Care records the number of patients who do not need to use a catheter as a vascular access for dialysis. Where we as the care provider are directly responsible, the proportion of patients with permanent vascular access serves as an indirect quality indicator. 11 The number of days patients are hospitalized over a 365-day dialysis treatment period per patient. This is relevant for determining the quality of care because more days spent in hospital significantly reduce the quality of life for dialysis patients and are particularly cost-intensive for health care systems. In 2020, we aimed to maintain the clinical care environment as stable as possible during the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the pandemic was felt in all regions with our most vulnerable population of patients. However, the key clini- cal quality indicators showed a consistently high quality of care among our patients. Listening to our patients is also important when it comes to their choice of therapy. We treat our patients across the full spectrum of chronic kidney disease. We aim at giving them a more informed choice and providing treatment options that best fit their life circumstances. In 2020, for example, we offered home therapy to more than 44,000 peritoneal and hemodialysis patients who choose to be treated in a familiar environment and whose medical condition allows them to do so. In the U.S. alone, we educated more than 50,000 people liv- ing with chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease about home dialysis options with the help of more than 180 internal kidney care experts. Digitizing health care Digital technologies open new perspectives for treating patients. Innovations in this field help to improve the effective- ness of medical treatment. They provide physicians with better information for making decisions and educate patients more effectively about their treatment. Digital transformation can also improve access to health care services. In the U.S., we launched our connected health platform TheHub at the end of 2019. This improves collaboration between patients, care teams, and providers via an app. In 2020, more than 1.7 million sessions in the app were documented. In various countries in Europe, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America, we are using the mycompanion app as a new channel to reach our patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, telehealth also played a critical role in reducing the exposure risk for patients and health care workers. By enabling virtual contact, we minimized the risk of infection on both sides. At the same time, digitiza- tion raises the bar when it comes to protecting patient data. More information on data protection and data privacy at Fresenius Medical Care can be found in the section Safeguard- ing data starting on page 94. For more information on digitiza- tion initiatives, see the Group Management Report starting on page 34. Collaborating to improve health care We work with research partners to facilitate scientific progress and explore new ways to improve care. In 2020, we were involved in more than 40 key partnerships with academia, research institutes, and peer companies. Focus areas were, for example, cardio-protection, personalized and precise medicine, research and innovation as well as public health. This also includes the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable patient popula- tions. We are also members of several professional organiza- tions, including the American Nephrology Nurses Association, the American Society of Nephrology, the Renal Physicians Association, and the European Renal Association  European Dialysis and Transplant Association. More information on our collaboration with research and inno- vation partners can be found in the Group Management Report starting on page 34. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE Providing access to health care is an important topic that cov- ers a broad range of activities. We support the development of infrastructure for renal care and cooperate with authorities to offer affordable care to a growing number of patients. Innovative digital services and products also help improve access to health care services and flexibility for patients. In cri- sis and emergency situations, we benefit from our vertically integrated organization to provide access to health care for patients in need. Patient support in emerging countries Demand for affordable health care products is growing in emerging markets. To facilitate access to dialysis treatment, we have developed the 4008A dialysis machine which meets high therapy standards while reducing costs for health care systems. At the same time, it is designed to be easy to handle even in challenging infrastructures and remote locations. In 2019, the 4008A dialysis machine was successfully launched in Asian emerging markets, including India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh. More information on new products geared to emerging mar- kets can be found in the Group Management Report starting on page 34. Patient support in crisis and emergency situations Fresenius Medical Care operates dialysis facilities in many regions of the world with diverse geographic, social and eco- nomic conditions. We serve a vulnerable population of patients who need regular dialysis treatment multiple days a week. To ensure that patients receive their dialysis treatment, even in extreme conditions, we have developed robust emergency response systems. For example, we have a system of regionally organized emergency response teams in place to ensure busi- ness continuity. In addition to our disaster response activities, we repeatedly donate funds, dialysis machines, and medical supplies to organizations that urgently require support. The COVID-19 pandemic presented Fresenius Medical Care with an extraordinary challenge in 2020. Our patients have a high risk of suffering complications in case of a COVID-19 infection. We established strict safety protocols in our more than 4,000 clinics to maintain the provision of essential treatments while reducing the risk of infection for patients and staff. Mea- sures included screening all patients and staff entering the clin- ics and providing them with personal protective equipment. We also set up isolation centers for infected patients. Under these circumstances, we treated more than 29,000 patients with COVID-19 in North America. In addition, we rolled out an expanded telehealth platform to support social distancing for both home and in-center patients. Acute kidney injury is com- mon in critically ill COVID-19 patients. We provided hundreds of acute dialysis devices and other supplies to hospitals for emer- gency treatment. Despite the increased safety measures, we were able to continue producing and delivering life-saving products, even when our operations and supply chains were hampered by global restrictions. For more information on measures to protect our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, see the Employees section starting on page 88. For further information on COVID-19 relief measures, please see the notes to the consolidated financial statements starting on page 175. PRODUCT SAFETY AND QUALITY We produce and deliver a broad range of products for treating kidney disease. With our network of 44 manufacturing sites in more than 20 countries, we take care of the procurement, pro- duction, distribution, and supply of renal and multi-organ ther- apy products. We manage the quality and safety of our product business over the entire product life cycle, from design and development to operation and application. Two global functions are responsible for our product business: Global Research and Development and Global Manufacturing, Quality and Supply. Both functions report directly to the Man- agement Board. They have jointly developed our Global Quality Policy, which describes our commitment to product and service quality. It also covers our obligation to comply with relevant regulations and maintain environmentally sound and efficient operations. The Global Quality Policy is the basis for regional quality manuals and further detailed policies that describe aspects such as responsibilities, training, risk assessments, and audits. The Management Board is regularly informed about our global quality performance. Certification and audits We are subject to governmental regulation in virtually every country in which we operate. This includes, for example, the EU legislation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) EC 1907 / 2006, the Restric- tion of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) 2011 / 65 / EU, the Medical Device Directive (MDD) 93 / 42 / EEC as well as the new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017 / 745. Further, it includes the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Our safety and quality processes are embedded in quality man- agement systems as defined by legal and regulatory require- ments. As a result, all our products need to comply with safety and quality standards. This covers their development to market approval, manufacturing, use in clinics, customer training, and dealing with complaints. In 2019, we harmonized our quality management systems in the regions Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and parts of North America into one consolidated quality management system. We intend to leverage synergies so that we can respond faster to market developments and work together more efficiently to design and manufacture products. We have set ourselves the goal of implementing a global quality management system by 2024. As part of our initiative to harmonize our quality systems and processes worldwide, we are planning to introduce a global electronic training system within the next three years. Our consolidated quality management system is certified according to ISO 9001 and ISO 13485. In addition, our plants are subject to regular external quality audits and reviews in accordance with local requirements. Of the production sites managed by our Global Manufacturing, Quality and Supply function, 21 are certified with ISO 9001 / 13485. Furthermore, 17 sites have been audited according to the Good Manufactur- ing Practice (GMP) or the Current Good Manufacturing Prac- tice (cGMP) guidelines. We also successfully completed the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) in 10 of our sites as well as for our consolidated quality management system. This enabled us to reach a higher level of efficiency and reduce the cost per audit. Additional internal quality audits at our local sites help us determine the effectiveness of our quality management sys- tems and check conformity with regulations and standards. Internal audits are carried out at least once a year at each of our plants, following a risk-based approach. We have defined key performance indicators that help us mon- itor our quality objectives and prevent adverse events before they occur. We disclose the audit score, which measures our performance in certification audits and indicates the ratio of major and critical findings to the number of external audits. In 2020, more than 60 certification audits were performed at our manufacturing sites that are managed by the Global Manufac- turing, Quality and Supply function. The audit score was 0.2. We have set ourselves the target not to exceed an audit score of 1.0 per audit to ensure the effectiveness of our quality man- agement systems and certifications. All findings are docu- mented and escalated depending on how critical they are. We determine and implement appropriate corrective and preven- tive measures. TaBLe 3.3 shows the certification of our plants and TaBLe 3.4 the audit scores. Product improvements Continuous improvement is an essential prerequisite for enhancing the quality and safety of our products. Product improvements are a key performance indicator defined as changes that focus on at least one of the following: patient safety and quality, product performance, or customer service. We take the perspective of patient safety and product quality in our evaluation. Product improvements that only have a finan- cial advantage but do not benefit the patient are not taken into consideration. In 2020, we implemented more than 440 prod- T 3.3 CERTIFICATION OF OUR PLANTS ISO uct improvements to our dialysis machines and are planning to extend this KPI to further product groups in 2021. We also carry out product innovations with the aim of continu- ously improving our portfolio. To enable access to the latest technologies, we invest in research and development and col- laborate with external partners, including academic institu- tions. We also invest in startups that develop products, technol- ogies, and therapies in the health care sector. Post-market surveillance is also an integral part of our quality management. It is essential that our products and services are effective and reliable. At the same time, they should pose as low a risk as possible for our patients. Our standards for planning, conducting, and monitoring clinical studies, for example, help us to enhance the quality and safety of our products and improve our patients health. We monitor the safety and efficacy of medicines and medical devices in accor- dance with legal requirements. One way of doing so is to con- duct clinical studies. Reporting adverse events and product complaints We strive to ensure compliance with legal requirements related EMPLOYEES Our worldwide team is key to our success as the worlds leading dialysis company. In the reporting year, we had a workforce of 133,129 employees (125,364 full-time equivalents, FTE) around the world. In line with our business objectives, we updated our Global People Strategy in 2020. Our aim is to provide an engaging, fair, and trusting work environment for all employees to sup- port their growth and contribution to the Companys success. With this background, our Global People Strategy has four pri- orities: (1) Engage employees; (2) ensure that the right capabil- ities are available to support our business goals; (3) continuous advancement of our organization; and (4) excellent global human resources (HR) management practices. Our global HR function is responsible for the People Strategy and reports directly to Fresenius Medical Cares CEO. The func- tion manages the further development of human resources policies and processes and drives the alignment of HR across all regions and functions. 2020 was a challenging year for people working in health care.

We promptly adapted our protection measures and guidelines worldwide and supported our employees in implementing them. Striving to ensure busi- ness continuity in our clinics and production sites, we provided personal protective equipment, cleaning concepts, and addi- tional staffing, among others. We also offered specific groups of employees financial and non-financial support. Moreover, we increased employee opportunities for flexible working, created new opportunities for virtual learning and education, and adapted our organization to the requirements of a virtual envi- ronment. We organized events and initiatives to recognize our employees contributions and dedication to our patients. EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE At the end of 2020, the number of employees at Fresenius Med- ical Care increased by 4,829 from 128,300 employees in the previous year. This was due to organic business growth and acquisitions, both of which were impacted by COVID-19 related personnel requirements. Most of our employees work in the area of production and services (86 %), followed by adminis- trative functions (10 %). The region with the largest number of employees is North America (50 %), followed by EMEA (17 %). In the year under review, we hired more than 30,800 new employees. Fresenius Medical Care gained around 1,560 new employees through acquisitions. Compared to the prior year, our voluntary turnover rate decreased to 11.9 %. The average tenure of our employees increased from 6.8 years in 2019 to 7.3 years in 2020. To attract and retain talented employees, we stepped up our employer branding activities and initiated activities based on turnover assessments. In 2020, our priority in this area was to harmo- nize our employer brand design, building on the positive expe- riences of the previous relaunch in North America. In addition, we continued to work on enhancing our desirability to candi- dates and potential applicants for employment. We did this by further optimizing the employees experience and developing a positive reception as an employer in the labor market, among others. In 2021, we are planning to launch our global employer brand to other local markets in which we operate. Information on personnel expenses can be found in the Group Management Report starting on page 36. ATTRACTING AND DEVELOPING TALENT When it comes to hiring talented staff, we face increasingly strong competition in our business environment that requires us to continuously advance and improve from a HR perspec- tive. We want to be an attractive employer and recruit, engage, and retain excellent employees. We are continuously developing our employment standards and HR policies to achieve consistency and transparency in our working conditions and provide equal opportunities for our employees. One key element of this is the implementation of a standardized global HR system that supports our global and local business needs and facilitates new ways of working. In 2020, we started working on the new global HR platform in Asia-Pacific. North America and Latin America will follow in 2021. Moving forward, we intend to consolidate our core HR processes and services and deliver them via this tool. We have also updated our framework on compliance in HR processes. It aims to strengthen and foster compliant, ethical, and value- driven behavior across our organization. As part of this, we have revised HR standards and policies globally from recruit- ing to rewarding, retaining, and recognizing employees. We plan to roll out this revised framework in 2021, including com- munication and training for managers, employees, and HR professionals. We attach great importance to our employees development. Our goal is to support our managers and employees personal growth and their efforts to help others grow. We approach learning and development from three angles: (1) We provide the digital and non-digital infrastructure to foster learning and development. All our employees around the world participate in formalized or mandatory training via our existing learning platforms that support offline and online learning. (2) We enhance the attractiveness of learning and development by increasing the opportunities to learn and improving the learn- ing experience. In addition to our existing platforms, around 25,000 employees started using our new digital platforms with knowledge and training resources in 2020. (3) We ensure that our executives are prepared and equipped to provide ongoing development support. In 2020, we also introduced a digital platform to foster the dialog between managers and their teams on the topics of development and performance manage- ment. More than 1,500 managers have already started using this platform. We identify and promote outstanding talent on an ongoing basis and invest in building a sustainable talent pipeline for our top 400 positions and beyond. Our different programs for lead- ership development are based on regional requirements but with a focus on principles that apply globally. For example, since 2014, over 5,000 managers have completed our regional leadership development program in North America. Regarding the development of our compensation systems, the Management Board decided on the implementation of a new global leadership bonus plan in 2020. According to this plan, all senior executives are given a comparable mix of global, busi- ness-specific, and individual objectives. The aim is to improve the consistency, alignment, and fairness of our senior leader- ship targets and ensure recognition. The plan will be imple- mented in 2021. EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT We value the contribution of our employees and are adapting our processes to include their feedback on a continuous basis. Our global employee engagement surveys are tools to identify strengths as well as opportunities to improve our work environ- ment. We conduct one full employee engagement survey every two years and pulse checks in the years in-between. We use the survey results to define and initiate global and local mea- sures with the aim of further improving engagement levels in the long term. Based on the results of our 2019 global engage- ment survey, we initiated various follow-up measures on a global and regional level. We intensified global communication on this topic and worked out dedicated action plans, among others. In 2020, we conducted a pulse survey with more than 16,000 employees worldwide, which revealed that 64 % of the participating employees are actively engaged. The employee engagement score is based on three aspects: say (speak posi- tively about Fresenius Medical Care), stay (intend to stay at Fresenius Medical Care), and strive (make an extra effort to pro- mote Fresenius Medical Care). Compared to 2019, the engage- ment rate improved by eight percentage points. We are plan- ning to conduct the next full global engagement survey in 2021 to further facilitate and build on this feedback. Inclusion and diversity Our employees are located in 67 countries. Creating an inclu- sive work environment where all employees feel welcome is key to providing an attractive work environment. This applies regardless of, for example, their age, gender, nationality, cul- tural and ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, educa- tional background, and work experience. We strive to create a culture that promotes belonging and enables employees to contribute perspectives and skills to the Companys success. Our commitment to inclusion and diversity is also incorpo- rated in our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. We started a new global initiative on this topic as part of our Sustainabil- ity Program. We focus on identifying and implementing effective ways to enhance the benefits of a diverse workforce. In 2020, our objec- tive was to gain a global overview of the current situation and define the scope of global initiatives for inclusion and diversity. In 2021, we are planning to further develop our global initia- tives and enhance our communication activities. For example, we are planning to initiate a global communication and aware- ness campaign, as well as leadership and employee focus ses- sions on diversity. Inclusion and diversity in leadership is an important factor for the development of our business. Fresenius Medical Cares management team reflects our international footprint in vari- ous markets. Of the more than 1,150 senior leaders of the Com- pany who take part in our Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), 85 % are non-German. Fresenius Medical Care had 69 % female employees at Decem- ber 31, 2020. Gender diversity in our main governance bodies and at management level has increased over time. The propor- tion of women on the Management Board was 25 % at the end of the reporting year. In 2020, we set ourselves new global tar- gets for the percentage of women in leadership positions. The Management Board defined a new target of 22 % for the share of women in the first management level below the Manage- ment Board and 32 % in the second management level, to be achieved by 2025. The new targets follow the fulfillment of tar- gets set in 2016. We intend to further strengthen inclusion and diversity beyond gender diversity over the next few years. This includes, among others, a greater focus on ethnicity, sexual ori- entation, and disability. More information on gender diversity in our leadership popula- tion can be found in the Corporate Governance report starting on page 115. Dialog with employee representatives At Fresenius Medical Care, we believe that the best way to inter- act with our employees is through open and direct communica- tion. We are committed to giving prompt and fair attention to questions, concerns, or issues raised by employees. We encour- age employees to speak directly with their supervisors. They can also reach out to any other supervisor, manager or to Human Resources. We act responsibly towards our employees. It is also part of our commitment to comply with applicable social and labor standards. We have defined this commitment in our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and in our global statement on Human Rights, Workplace Rights and Labor and Employment Principles. We are committed to working constructively with elected or established employee representative bodies. Where our employees choose to be represented by a collective body, we are committed to cooperating in good faith with it. In doing so, we act in accordance with applicable laws and practices. Import- ant partners in this respect include the local works councils in Germany as well as Fresenius SEs European Works Council, which represents our workforce in Europe. In 2020, Fresenius SE and its European Works Council agreed to hold annual meetings for a dialog on labor rights and social matters. Representatives from the global unions and represen- tatives of the different Fresenius SE business segments, includ- ing Fresenius Medical Care, will take part in these meetings. Collective bargaining agreements apply to different groups of employees within Fresenius Medical Care, depending on local laws and practices. This is the case for the majority of our employees covered by collective pay agreements in Germany. In Europe, this applies to around 42 % of our employees. We are also bound by labor and collective agreements in some of our locations in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and North America. The business units at country or site level are responsible for working with local employee representatives and trade unions. Our discussions with these representatives focus on local and regional matters and conditions. More information on employee grievance mechanisms can be found in the Promoting integrity section starting on page 93. For more information on our labor standards and human rights principles, see the Human rights section starting on page 96. HEALTH AND SAFETY We give top priority to the health and safety of our employees. Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct includes our commit- ment to provide a safe and healthy work environment for our global team. We expect the same from our business partners. Responsibility for occupational health and safety lies with local management. The respective standards for health and safety are defined in local and regional policies. This allows us to comply with different regulatory and legal requirements and report incidents to authorities based on local specifications. Several of our production sites and clinics in the region Europe, Middle East and Africa are certified according to international health and safety standards, including ISO 45001. We are currently working on harmonizing our management concepts for occupational health and safety as part of our Global Sus- tainability Program. In addition, we are planning to develop a global policy and indicators to reflect our worldwide perfor- mance in this area. Our goal is to prevent work-related illnesses and injuries. For this reason, we track and analyze accidents and injuries at local and regional level, identify their root causes, and implement corrective actions. As part of these activities, we have intro- duced different performance indicators for occupational health and safety in our production sites and dialysis clinics based on local requirements. These indicators generally focus on work-related accidents, including the incident rate and lost time incident rate. In 2020, we started to assess local health and safety policies and goals in all regions. In the region Europe, Middle East and Africa, for example, health and safety targets relate to incident rates, safety training, and incident reporting. To avoid incidents and increase awareness, we also provide training on health and safety. In our clinics, employee training courses cover topics such as the safe use of sharps and dispos- ables as well as hand hygiene. Further topics include infection prevention and emergency control. Training provided in our production sites focuses, for instance, on the safe handling of work equipment or hazardous chemicals as well as on emer- gency prevention and response. In the U.S. alone, more than 46,000 employees completed health and safety training. We carry out risk assessments on the operational safety of machines and technical equipment as part of our work safety program in our production facilities. Internal reviews and exter- nal audits by authorities are conducted to monitor compliance with corresponding regulations, policies, and procedures. Our commitment to providing a healthy work environment also includes initiatives for flexible working hours and workplaces where this is compatible with operational requirements. Depending on the regional conditions, we implement additional measures to support our employees wellbeing. In North Amer- ica, for example, we offer employees access to a digital plat- form that provides personal recommendations and activities to help employees stay fit, eat better, manage stress, and improve their sleep. Over 20,000 employees use this platform actively. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the safety and health of our patients, employees, their families, and the communities in which we work were at the focus of our response activities. We implemented various measures to protect our employees and patients against exposure to the virus. In our clinics, we stepped up infection control practices that were already in place in order to protect both our patients and our staff. We introduced strict hygienic measures in the production facilities, such as disinfection and distancing measures. From March 2020, many of our employees in administrative functions worked from home to avoid infection. Further information on measures to protect our patients can be found in the section Responsibility for patients starting on page 84. TaBLe 3.5 ON page 92 shows the employment overview.

PROMOTING INTEGRITY COMPLIANCE Fresenius Medical Care has a global compliance program in place. Its purpose is to ensure adherence to legal requirements and our internal company guidelines. The program is based on our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, a binding framework that governs how our employees interact with patients, col- leagues, business partners, officials, and society. The Code covers topics that are relevant for our business  from patient care, quality, anti-corruption and bribery to health and safety, data privacy, and environmental protection. It also includes our commitment to respecting human rights regard- ing topics such as working conditions, non-discrimination, and grievance mechanisms. In 2020, we revised our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct to integrate relevant additions and updates. The guidelines of the Code are mandatory for the Companys employees and managers, including members of the Management Board. The Code applies to the operations of all direct and indirect subsidiaries that are majority-owned or controlled by us in some other way. Our Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for managing and enhancing the compliance management system and organiza- tion. He reports to the CEO and is supported by a global network of more than 180 compliance professionals. As partners for our business units, they provide advice and support in all regions. Prevent, detect and respond We are committed to operating our business in compliance with the law. The primary goal of the compliance program is there- fore to prevent, detect, and respond to potential misconduct and violations. We want to establish a corporate culture in which compliance is recognized as everyones responsibility. A key element in the prevention of compliance violations is our training program. We make compliance training mandatory for employees in all countries and locations where we are legally permitted to do so. In our compliance guidelines, we have defined the target that every employee receives compliance training at least once every two years. In 2020, we also conducted a general e-learning class on anti-bribery and anti-corruption as well as over 20 specialized training courses for specific target groups. Our aim is to provide compliance training to every employee. In the U.S. alone, more than 63,000 employees and contractors completed compliance training in 2020. We are continuously expanding our training program. In 2020, we also further intensified our leadership communication to employees worldwide to promote a culture of ethical business behavior. Monitoring adherence to standards Our compliance program defines standards and procedures including corrective action for failure to follow policies. To iden- tify the risk of compliance violations, we perform systematic assessments as part of our enterprise risk management. Peri- odic internal audits are another way to detect risks. All employees are encouraged to report potential cases of non-compliance as well as actual or perceived misconduct that violates our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, other com- pany guidelines or laws. There are several ways in which they can do so: employees can reach out to their managers, their superiors or to specialists in functions such as Compliance, Legal or Human Resources. In addition, we have set up an external hotline system operated by an independent, certified third-party vendor for our employees and related third parties to report potential violations of laws or company guidelines. If desired and where legally permitted, reports can be made anonymously. The system is available 24 hours a day and reports can be made in several languages. We also have an anti-retaliation policy in place. In North America, our hotline system can be used not only for reporting compliance concerns, but also for submitting patient care reports and information security reports. Each report is documented and reviewed based on more than 30 allegation categories. In 2020, a total of 3,003 reports were received via various reporting channels. The reports covered topics such as busi- ness integrity including anti-corruption (1.7 %), data protection (11.4 %), patient care and products (50.5 %), and human resources / workplace (30.2 %). We investigate all cases of potential misconduct, take correc- tive measures on a case-by-case basis, and track their imple- mentation. From the compliance reports concluded in 2020, a total of 392 led to consequential measures. These can include improving processes as well as disciplinary actions that may also result in termination of employment. In the year under review, we rolled out a global disciplinary action guideline. It sets consistent rules and principles of how the Company will respond to misconduct. TaBLe 3.6 ON page 94 shows the topics of the reports received and TaBLe 3.7 ON page 94 the number of reports passed on to different departments for processing.

Enhancing our compliance program In 2020, we continued to enhance our global compliance pro- gram with additional measures connected to our activities with third parties. In the course of the year, we completed the review of our third-party due diligence concept and rolled out an updated process. As part of this roll-out, we assessed some 37,000 third parties for compliance risks. This process is cur- rently being extended to cover additional measures in relation to selected external partners. We are also building on existing local programs for selected third parties, such as distributors, to develop a globally consistent training approach in 2021. In March 2019, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and a separate agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with the aim of resolving the U.S. governments allegations against the Com- pany concerning violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Prac- tices Act (FCPA). Both have a three years term, starting in August 2019. As part of the resolution, we agreed to certain disclosure obligations to the U.S. government and to hire an independent compliance monitor to ensure and test the effec- tiveness of the Companys enhanced compliance and financial controls outside the U.S. This includes high-level commitment, policies and procedures, periodic risk-based reviews, proper oversight, and independence. Further important aspects are training and guidance, internal reporting, enforcement and dis- cipline, third-party relationships, mergers and acquisitions, and monitoring and testing. More information on compliance measures can be found in the Group Management Report starting on page 62. SAFEGUARDING DATA Our patients, employees, customers and business partners entrust us with their personal data. As a company with interna- tional operations, we are subject to different local privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Privacy program and strategy To comply with varying legal requirements around the world, we have established dedicated privacy programs in the regions to help ensure that personal data are used appropriately. While the privacy program is a baseline requirement to which all Fresenius Medical Care affiliates are obliged to adhere, we are also committed to complying with applicable local laws that may impose stricter standards. Our privacy program is over- seen by the Management Board, which is informed on a bi- annual basis of the program status and any privacy-related issues that need to be brought to its attention. Based on our corporate structure, we have created a network of more than 60 privacy liaison officers throughout the Com- pany to put our privacy strategy into practice. In accordance with this approach, each Fresenius Medical Care affiliate is accountable for establishing and implementing the baseline global privacy program as a minimum requirement for its oper- ations. This includes designating resources with appropriate qualifications based on their background, experience, educa- tion, and training. To drive forward the execution of the privacy program, dedicated privacy experts are assigned both at regional and local level. Digital technologies are a key enabler in the globalization of business. They enhance our ability to communicate, share, and store information. From a risk management perspective, we regularly assess risks related to data protection and IT secu- rity. Responsibility for carrying out data protection measures, including risk assessments and monitoring, lies with the func- tional departments. In North America, regional policies and procedures are developed based on the ISO 27001 and 27002 standards for information security. This provides us with a consistent framework that addresses security issues relating to protecting information based on industry standards and best practices. As part of our business operations, we may transfer personal data to third parties that support Fresenius Medical Cares busi- ness activities on our behalf or within the Fresenius group. We have implemented standards to cover this. They also specify that data transfers outside the country of origin must comply with all applicable privacy export obligations. This includes compliance with national and local privacy laws, international agreements and personal commitments to those whose data we process. Cybersecurity We have implemented a program to consolidate cybersecurity measures. The CARE (Cybersecurity Approach, Roadmap and Execution) program is designed to protect critical information assets. These include patient and employee data in all clinics, production sites, medical devices, and IT environments. The CARE program applies to all regions as well as to the two global functions Global Research and Development and Global Manu- facturing, Quality and Supply. Based on a cross-business gover- nance model, it aims to identify cyber risks and to harmonize and improve security standards and policies. It also enables us to meet global data security requirements, including the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cyberse- curity framework. We have established a global, cross-segment team to follow up on suspected violations and potential attacks on our informa- tion assets. To be able to respond to cybersecurity incidents, we have implemented business continuity plans and incident response procedures, which we test regularly. In September 2020, a new CARE Steering Committee was established by Fresenius SE. It consists of the Group Head of Cyber Security and one board member from each business segment. Our Chief Financial Officer Helen Giza represents Fresenius Medical Care in this committee. As part of our corporate risk management, we continuously monitor risks related to data protection and IT security. This means that we use standardized methods in a top-down approach to analyze data security and privacy risks in connec- tion with projects, systems, and third-party services on a continuous basis. We bring risks to the attention of the Man- agement Board if necessary. We intend to provide an addi- tional quarterly update to the Management Board on cyberse- curity risks. Procedures that involve the processing of personal data are also subject to regular audits carried out by our Global Internal Audit department. Audit activities in 2020 focused on cybersecurity readiness as well as incident response, among others. Responsibility to owners of personal data As stated in our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, we will only collect personal data in cases where we have a legal basis and legitimate business need to do so. As digitization trans- forms all spheres of life, it is increasingly important that people are informed about how their personal data are used, collected and shared. We are committed to respecting and protecting the rights of all those who entrust us with their data. We disclose how we process their personal data and make sure that they can access, review, and request to correct and delete them. In May 2020, Fresenius Medical Care was a victim of a Ransom- ware attack. Due to this cybersecurity attack, some patients personal data was unfortunately published illegally. The cyber- security breach was reported to the relevant government authorities. Furthermore, we contacted the affected patients without delay and took immediate remedial action. We also filed a complaint against the attackers with the public prosecu- tor in Germany. Remedial measures included implementing an improved program to protect devices and users from external attacks, increasing the focus on Group-wide risk assessments as well as defining a new set of metrics to measure perfor- mance and risk exposure at Group level. Awareness and training As it is important to educate our workforce about data security and protection, we provide training that is appropriate for their specific job. Moreover, our regions educate our employees on current requirements and threats in relation to data protection and IT security. We offer them a range of e-learning opportuni- ties and classroom training courses and combine general train- ing with targeted measures for specific employee groups. This helps to ensure that employees responsible for data processing are aware of current internal and external requirements. Third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf are also expected to meet our standards of conduct. Furthermore, we expect them to comply with our information security and privacy policies as well as applicable laws. In 2020, we contin- ued to roll out our data privacy training as part of an interna- tional training program that provides details on our values and the measures we take to protect personal data. In 2020, we offered more than 160 training classes on data privacy to our employees around the world. In the U.S. alone, more than 62,000 employees and contractors participated in training on data privacy and security. More information on Fresenius Medical Cares risk manage- ment can be found in the Group Management Report starting on page 62. HUMAN RIGHTS Respect for human rights is part of our corporate responsibility. In the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, we have committed ourselves to conducting our business in a legal and ethical manner consistent with our global values and international human rights standards. In 2019, the Management Board adopted our global Human Rights, Workplace Rights and Labor and Employment Princi- ples. Our activities are guided by the standards described in the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We are committed to respecting these international standards worldwide and to complying with the applicable laws and prac- tices of the countries in which we do business. The Global Labor Law function is responsible for human rights topics at Fresenius Medical Care. Cross-functional teams cooperate to further develop human rights policies and proce- dures as part of our Global Sustainability Program. Overall progress is overseen by both a Human and Labor Rights Steering Committee and the Management Board. The Steer- ing Committee comprises senior managers from different areas who prepare the basis for Management Board deci- sions. They provide the Management Board with regular updates. In 2020, we developed a global policy on respectful work behavior. This policy specifies our company standards in the areas of non-discrimination, non-harassment, and non-bullying. We are planning to roll it out worldwide in 2021. We will also implement a global policy on the prohibition of child labor and modern slavery, including forced labor and human trafficking in the same year. To facilitate the sharing of practices and experience among different business segments of Fresenius SE, experts from Fresenius Medical Care are members in Fresenius SEs Human Rights Council. In 2020, they attended all four Council meetings. IDENTIFYING AND MANAGING OUR IMPACT ON HUMAN RIGHTS To regularly assess the Companys actual and potential impact on human rights, we have developed a due diligence approach. Topics relating to human rights are integrated into our corpo- rate risk management process and continuously monitored. In 2020, we initiated a global human and labor rights risk assess- ment. The methodology used is based on the requirements of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Depending on the outcomes of this assessment, we are plan- ning to derive further measures. Various channels are available to employees, patients and other third parties to report potential violations of laws and company policies. To enhance our grievance management approach, we started an analysis of our existing grievance mechanisms in 2020. For this, we used the effectiveness crite- ria of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. AWARENESS AND COLLABORATION We have intensified our communication on our commitments and activities relating to human rights. Our aim here is to raise awareness among our employees. In 2020, for example, we held virtual awareness sessions to inform our leadership teams about our global Human Rights, Workplace Rights and Labor and Employment Principles. We are planning to incorporate our requirements and expectations with regard to human rights to a greater extent in the mandatory training for employees on our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct in 2021. We will also include the topic in training programs for procurement person- nel on our new Supplier Code of Conduct. Furthermore, we are committed to integrating external per- spectives in our human rights due diligence concept. In 2020, for example, we joined the Human Rights Working Group of Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), a global nonprofit organization with a network of more than 250 member compa- nies and other partners. More information on our patient grievance mechanisms can be found in the Responsibility for patients section starting on page 84. For more information on employee and third-party grievance mechanisms, see the Promoting integrity section starting on page 93. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION We are dedicated to developing, producing, and applying our products and services in a sustainable way. This means that we pay attention to how our business impacts the environment. We monitor the environmental performance of our operations globally and aim to use resources efficiently. At the same time, we need to ensure that the safety and quality of our products and services is not compromised. Our global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct includes our commitment to work continuously to reduce any adverse effects of our activities on the environment. In accordance with the Code, we are also committed to increasing awareness of environmental issues. Our standards and procedures for envi- ronmental management are defined in various policies and manuals based on regional requirements. One example is our environmental policy for the global Research and Development organization and our manufacturing function in the regions Latin America and Europe, Middle East and Africa. In accor- dance with this policy, complying with environmental laws, enhancing our eco-performance, preventing pollution, and recycling waste are core elements of our efforts to protect the environment. In our vertically integrated organization, responsibility for envi- ronmental management is shared between global and regional functions. Our Global Manufacturing, Quality and Supply func- tion under the leadership of Kent Wanzek, member of the Man- agement Board, is accountable for sustainable plant operations in our manufacturing business. Responsibility for environmen- tal protection in our clinics lies with the respective manage- ment in the Companys four regions. We identify and evaluate environmental risks as part of our enterprise risk management. In 2020, we additionally per- formed an assessment on water scarcity risks at our manufac- turing sites. As part of our Global Sustainability Program, we have set ourselves the objective to develop and implement a harmonized global environmental strategy, including a new, global environmental policy and impact reduction targets. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT We monitor and analyze environmental data from our clinics and manufacturing sites around the globe. We use different systems to monitor energy and water consumption and to help reduce the use of resources. These systems help us to improve the quality and consistency of environmental data. To further increase data quality and boost efficiency in environmental reporting, we prepared the launch of a new digital eco-report- ing tool in 2020. This tool will aggregate regional environmen- tal data on a global level. It also provides us with a foundation to report further environmental data in the years to come. We monitor national and international regulations concerning environmental issues on an ongoing basis so that our internal policies, guidelines, and standard operating procedures are up-to-date. External certifications complement our own envi- ronmental standards if they add value. In 2020, a total of 10 production sites were certified according to ISO 14001 stan- dards. In addition, 2 production sites have ISO 50001 certifica- tion. Our manufacturing sites, distribution centers, laborato- ries, and clinics are subject to internal and external audits in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. REDUCING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT At our manufacturing sites, we are involved in local sustainabil- ity projects which we report as part of our global Green & Lean initiative. This is part of our efforts to continuously improve our environmental performance. The management of each plant is responsible for defining, planning, and implementing environ- mental initiatives. Our Green & Lean reporting enables best practices to be shared across the organization with a view to reducing emissions, promoting the efficient use of natural resources, and increasing recycling rates. By the end of 2020, more than 70 initiatives were reported. They demonstrated improved production processes and recycling activities, among others. Consequently, we were able to save water and energy and reduce the amount of waste produced at various manufac- turing sites. Water Large amounts of water are required for hemodialysis treat- ment and for cleaning and setting up the machines. The water for dialysis must have a high quality to avoid infections for patients. For this reason, most of the water used by Fresenius Medical Care is municipal water. In 2020, our reported water consumption decreased by 3 % compared to the preceding year (See TaBLe 3.8 ON page 98). In the U.S., we run a program focused on reducing water during our pre-treatment process. This water reduction program within our clinics attributed to the decline of water consumption. In the reporting year, we performed a water scarcity risk assessment of our manufacturing sites with the Aqueduct tool of the World Resources Institute. According to the assessment, 7 % of the sites are in areas defined as a location with an extremely high risk of water scarcity. In a next step, we are planning to analyze water scarcity risks for the locations of our clinics. To generate water savings at manufacturing sites, we took part in several initiatives in 2020. We reviewed, for exam- ple, the water piping and pump connection points to eliminate leaks. In addition, several plants reclaimed water and wastewa- ter and reused it in other parts of the plant. This allowed us to minimize the total water consumption and the amount of con- taminated water.

Energy We monitor the energy consumption in our manufacturing sites as well as the electricity consumption in our dialysis centers (See TaBLe 3.9). We introduced measures to reduce energy con- sumption in several of our production sites in 2020, including the installation of improved energy meters to identify potential energy savings. In addition, we optimized engines and chillers to improve our production capabilities and adapt them better to environmental conditions. We will continue to replace fluo- rescent lighting with LED lighting in selected warehouses and production areas to save energy. As part of our Global Sustainability Program, we assessed the progress made on our renewable energy impact. To calculate this, we used the country-specific average share of renewables needed to produce electricity. According to this calculation, renewables accounted for 21 % of total electricity consumption in 2020.

Excluding mobile assets. Greenhouse gas emissions Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) at Fresenius Medical Care are calculated based on energy data reported by our manufactur- ing sites as well as electricity data reported by our dialysis clin- ics (See TaBLe 3.10). The calculation follows a location-based approach. Compared to the previous year, our direct (scope 1) emissions increased by 7 %. Increased production is among the drivers for this development. Our reported indirect (scope 2) emissions decreased by 4 %. This is mainly due to enhanced data reporting as well as lower emission factors provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA). We use these emission factors to calculate the indirect emissions from electricity. We are working on different projects to reduce GHG emissions. Our biggest plant in St. Wendel, Germany, accounted for around one fourth of the total GHG emissions reported by our manu- facturing sites in 2020. We operate an internal gas power plant with a heat recovery steam generator. This allows us to gener- ate close to 100 % of the electricity used at this site. In this way, we were able to save more than 23,800 tons of CO2 in 2020, compared to buying an energy mix from the electricity grid. This corresponds to a global avoidance of CO2 emissions of 6 % for total manufacturing.

In 2020, we also developed new transportation packaging sys- tems. These allow us to move more products at a time, result- ing in reduced fuel consumption and, consequently, lower CO2 emissions. As part of our Global Sustainability Program, we are planning to define qualitative environmental goals as well as quantitative reduction targets for GHG emissions. Waste In 2020, we increased our focus on waste. We analyzed the waste streams of our manufacturing sites and clinics in all our regions. Waste is managed on a local and regional level to cover applicable laws and regulations. Our aim is to continu- ously improve our waste management. In the context of our Global Sustainability Program, we are planning to develop a global approach to consolidate waste data and define reduc- tion targets. Waste initiatives in 2020 targeted the recycling and reuse of resources. To improve our environmental impact, we intend to increase the recycle rate and separate materials more effec- tively. We launched initiatives at various sites to recycle mate- rials such as paper, cardboard boxes, aluminum and metal cans as well as plastic canisters, bags and bottles. By doing so, we reduced the amount of landfill waste. IMPROVING THE ECO-PERFORMANCE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES We count on innovations to improve the environmental perfor- mance of our products and services. Most of the water utilized by Fresenius Medical Care is needed to produce dialysate during life-saving treatments in our dialysis centers. Our latest dialysis machine generations, the 5008 and 6008 series, are both designed to be more eco-friendly. They automatically adjust the dialysate flow to the patients blood flow. This allows us to save substantial amounts of dialysate, water, and energy while maintaining a consistently high dialysis quality. The 2008T BlueStar machine is another example of our ongoing efforts to limit the environmental footprint of dialysis. Com- pared to similar devices, the 2008T machine features an idle mode to reduce dialysate and water usage by up to two-thirds, thus saving additional costs. In 2020, almost every second dial- ysis machine we produced belonged to one of these resource- friendly machine generations. We also conduct simplified product life cycle assessments for selected products. By assessing the environmental impact along a products life cycle from raw material extraction to pro- duction, distribution, use, and disposal, we can identify pro- cesses and materials that we need to focus on to improve the eco-performance of our products and services. Based on inter- national guidelines, we calculate the environmental impact caused during the different stages of a products life cycle in accordance with ISO 14001 and the IEC 60601-1-9 standards. The latter standard applies to efforts to reduce the adverse environmental impact of medical electrical equipment. We cur- rently apply such life cycle assessments to the majority of our medical device product lines. We are gradually extending them to disposables, including bloodlines and peritoneal dialysis bags. We have also assessed the environmental impact of our dialysis machines and identified the life cycle phase with the highest impact. In 2021, we are planning to increasingly con- sider sustainability aspects in our research and development activities. In addition, we have conducted detailed comparative product life cycle assessments for important disposables. The assess- ments follow the structure and requirements of the ISO 14040 / 44 standards and compare the eco-performance of several of our acid concentrates and dialyzers.

Frankfurt am Main, February 22, 2021 PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft Nicolette Behncke ppa. Mirjam Kolmar Wirtschaftsprufer [German public auditor] C O R p O R a T e g O V e R N a N C e 102 FRE SENIUS MEDIC AL C ARE 2 0 2 0 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 103 REPORT BY THE SUPERVISORY BOARD 109 DECLARATION ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 124 COMPENSATION REPORT DR . DIETER S CHENK Chairman of the Supervisory Board REPORT BY THE SUPERVISORY BOARD For Fresenius Medical Care, the past fiscal year was character- ized by the Covid-19 pandemic and confronted the company with extraordinary challenges. As a healthcare company and global market leader in dialysis, Fresenius Medical Care is aware of its responsibility to improve the lives of patients around the world. The company can be proud that it has succeeded in guaranteeing medical care with its products and services despite the pandemic and the accompanying restrictions, and in maintaining high-quality production, supply chains and med- ical services. In economic terms, the year under review was successful for the company. Fresenius Medical Care achieved a solid revenue and a strong earnings growth and has reached its aims for the fiscal year 2020 despite the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr. Frank Maddux, MD, was appointed as a member of the Man- agement Board of the General Partner, Fresenius Medical Care Management AG, (hereinafter the Management Board) in his function as Global Chief Medical Officer with effect as of Janu- ary 1, 2020. He had previously been entrusted with the newly created position of Global Chief Medical Officer of the company and is to link clinical research and therapy even more closely. Apart from this new appointment, there were no significant events concerning the organization and composition of the Management Board or the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA (hereinafter the Company). The Supervisory Board also in the past fiscal year observed all duties imposed on it by law, the Articles of Association and the Rules of Procedure. In this context it also took into account the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code. The Supervisory Board supervised the General Partner within its responsibility and regularly advised the Management Board and was involved in decisions of fundamental importance to the company. All relevant questions of the business policy, the companys planning and the strategy were subject to the deliberations of the Supervisory Board. Reports of the Management Board on the progress of the business, the profitability and liquidity as well as on the situation and perspectives of the Company and the group formed the basis for the work of the Supervisory Board. Further topics were the risk situation and risk manage- ment. Additional items on the agenda were discussions on acquisition and investment projects. The Supervisory Board and its competent committees comprehensively discussed these as well as also all further significant business events. Fur- thermore, the Supervisory Board also in the past year reviewed the development of the acquisitions of the previous years. The Supervisory Board passed resolutions within its competencies according to law and the Articles of Association. MEETINGS In the past fiscal year, seven meetings of the Supervisory Board, some of which lasted several days, took place. Some of the meetings were held as video conferences due to the Covid- 19 pandemic and the associated travel and meeting restric- tions. The Supervisory Board also met regularly without the Management Board. The participation rate of the members in the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees was 100 %. The TaBLe 4.1 ON page 104 shows the participation of the members in the meetings of the Supervisory Board and the committees in the past fiscal year. T 4.1 PARTICIPATION OF MEMBERS OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD IN Mee TINgS aND Te LepHONe CONFe Re NCeS IN 2020 The Management Board and the Supervisory Board cooperate on a trust basis to the benefit of the company. The Supervisory Board was in regular contact with the Management Board and was always promptly and comprehensively informed by it. Between meetings, the Management Board reported to the Supervisory Board in writing. During the meetings, the Man- agement Board also informed the Supervisory Board verbally. In addition, the Supervisory Board also last year was in contact with members of the senior management level. The members of the Management Board were further available to the Super- visory Board for follow-up queries. The Chairman of the Super- visory Board maintained continuous contact with the Manage- ment Board outside the meetings, in particular with the Chairman of the Management Board and consulted with him questions regarding strategy, business development, the risk situation, risk management and compliance of the company. In case of important occasions or events, the Chairman of the Management Board promptly informed the Chairman of the Supervisory Board. In such cases, the Chairman of the Supervi- sory Board subsequently informed the other members of the Supervisory Board in the next meeting at the latest. During the entire fiscal year, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board also was in close contact with the other members of the Supervi- sory Board. In the year under review, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board was also available for communication with investors to the extent permitted by law and in close coordina- tion with the Management Board. FOCUS OF THE DISCUSSIONS IN THE SUPERVISORY BOARD One of the main focus areas of the Supervisory Boards discus- sions in the past year was supporting the Management Board in dealing with the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result of the comprehensive and early measures initiated by the company already at the very beginning of the pandemic, the impact on patients was minimized and operations at the more than 4,000 dialysis centers worldwide were maintained without major interruptions. Production at Fresenius Medical Cares worldwide manufacturing sites could also proceed largely without disturbances. Fresenius Medical Care also expanded home dialysis as an important growth area. In the second quarter of the year under review, the home dialysis offering was expanded in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. The integration of the NxStage home dialysis product portfolio in the EMEA region, which has now been completed, enables Fresenius Medical Care to offer even more patients treatment at home and a wider choice of treatment methods. Home dialysis is an important treatment option, particularly in the pandemic. The business development, the competitive situation and the Management Boards planning in the individual regions and functions were also focal points of the Supervisory Boards dis- cussions. In joint consultations with the Management Board, the development of the production quantities and their expan- sion were discussed. In the past year, the Supervisory Board also informed itself about the quality assurance systems and about the results of the product quality testing in the produc- tion facilities. Another major focus of the Supervisory Boards discussions in the past fiscal year was the Strategy 2025, which the Manage- ment Board announced in October 2020, and the financial plan- ning for the years 2021 to 2023. In the past fiscal year, the Supervisory Board again discussed the development of cost reimbursement in the various health care systems, in particular in the U.S. One focus of the discus- sions was, inter alia, the U.S.-American CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act), which is intended to compensate health care providers to a large extent for, among other things, the increased costs of measures to protect against Covid-19. With a view to the continued aim of increasing effi- ciency and the corresponding measures taken by the manage- ment already in previous years, the Supervisory Board further informed itself also in the past year about the success of the measures taken to improve the cost situation. In the year under review, the Supervisory Board submitted the revised system for the compensation of the Management Board (Compensation System 2020+) to the Annual General Meeting of the Company for approval. It further proposed to the Annual General Meeting that, as part of the upcoming auditor rotation, PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprufungsgesell- schaft be elected as auditor instead of KPMG AG Wirtschafts- prufungsgesellschaft, which had audited the financial state- ments of the Company and the group so far. The Annual General Meeting of the Company on August 27, 2020 approved both resolution proposals with a majority of 95.05 % and 98.82 %, respectively, of the votes cast. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Annual General Meeting of the Company in the year under review took place later than originally scheduled and, in line with the framework created by the legislator with short notice, was held as a virtual gen- eral meeting without the physical presence of shareholders or their proxies. In the year under review two bonds with an aggregate volume of  1.25 billion were successfully issued in May and a bond with a volume of $ 1 billion in September. In the year under review, the Company redeemed all of the approximately 11.8 million treasury shares it had acquired in the year under review and in previous years as part of share buy- back programs. The Supervisory Board was regularly informed about the com- panys compliance. Findings of the internal audit department were also taken into account. In particular, the Supervisory Board has also informed itself intensively and on an ongoing basis about the findings, assessments and recommendations of the independent expert (Monitor) engaged by the Company to monitor the internal compliance in fulfillment of its obligations under the agreements it entered into in March 2019 with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concerning violations of provi- sions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The Supervisory Board will continue to closely monitor this topic. COMMITTEES OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD The Supervisory Board has formed professionally qualified committees from among its members that support the Super- visory Board as a whole in its supervisory and advisory func- tions. The respective chairmen have regularly reported to the Supervisory Board on the work of the committees. Details of the composition of the Supervisory Boards committees can be found in the Declaration on Corporate Governance starting on page 109. Audit and Corporate Governance Committee The Audit and Corporate Governance Committee convened nine times in the past fiscal year. All members of this commit- tee - Messrs. Rolf A. Classon (Chairman) and William P. John- ston (Vice Chairman) as well as Ms. Pascale Witz - are financial experts according to Sec. 100 para. 5 of the German Stock Cor- poration Act (AktG). The Chairman of the Audit and Corporate Governance Committee Mr. Classon also has specific know- ledge and experience in applying accounting principles and internal control procedures and is also familiar with auditing. In the past year, the committee dealt with the annual and con- solidated financial statements, the proposal for the allocation of profit and the report according to Form 20-F for the SEC. It also discussed the quarterly reports with the Management Board. Furthermore, it dealt with the selection and the inde- pendence of the auditor of the annual and consolidated finan- cial statements. In doing so, it also considered any additional non-audit services provided. Also, the audit engagement per- taining to the audit of the consolidated financial statements according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the internal controls concerning the financial report- ing, which are part of the report according to Form 20-F, was issued by the committee. The committee further negotiated the fee agreement with the auditor. Audit focal points and fur- ther key audit matters of the past fiscal year were the goodwill impairment assessment for the groups of cash-generating units Latin America and EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), the valuation of receivables from dialysis treatments in the U.S., the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic for the finan- cial reporting including the reflection of the U.S.-American CARES Act in the income statement, the accounting of an investment in the U.S. at fair value, the potential consequences of cyber-attacks on the financial reporting, as well as, for the annual financial statements of the Company, the measurement of investments in affiliates as well as the recognition of net income from investments. Representatives of the auditor participated in all meetings of the committee and informed the members of the committee of their auditing activities. In addition, they provided information on any significant results of their audit and were available for additional information. In the absence of the members of the Management Board, they reported on the cooperation with them. The Audit and Corporate Governance Committee dealt with the supervision of the accounting and its process, with the effec- tiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system and the internal audit system as well as with the audit and compliance. The committee also dealt with the review of the internal control processes as well as with the measures taken by the Management Board for the successful elimination of the control weakness that had been identified in the previ- ous year and related to the design and effectiveness of the internal controls on the revenue recognition in the North America business segment. In the course of its audit, the audi- tor audited the internal control system in relation to the accounting processes, the electronic reproduction of the con- solidated financial statements and the group management report pursuant to Sec. 328 para. 1 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) (so-called ESEF documents) as well as the early risk recognition system. The audit showed that the General Partner has appropriately implemented the measures required under Sec. 91 para. 2 AktG, in particular regarding the establishment of a monitoring system, and that the monitoring system is suit- able for the early identification of developments that may endanger the continued existence of the Company. The Man- agement Board periodically reported to the committee on larger individual risks. It also regularly informed the committee on the compliance situation as well as on the audit plans and results of the internal audit. The committee again reviewed the business relations of the Fresenius Medical Care group companies to Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA and the latters affiliated companies. It was confirmed in each case that these relationships corresponded to those between unrelated third parties. Certain transactions of the Company with related parties may be subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board pursuant to Sec. 111b AktG since the German Act Implementing the Second Shareholder Rights Directive (ARUG II) came into force. The Supervisory Board has made use of the option to delegate the responsibility for the approval resolution to the Audit and Corporate Governance Committee. The prerequi- sites under which a transaction requires such approval did not arise in the year under review. In accordance with Sec. 111a para. 2 sentence 2 AktG, the Audit and Corporate Governance Committee reviewed whether transactions between the Com- pany and related parties were conducted in the ordinary course of business and at arms length. No objections were raised in this respect. The Chairman of the Audit and Corporate Governance Commit- tee has regularly reported to the Supervisory Board on the results of the discussions and resolutions in the committee. Nomination Committee The Nomination Committee prepares candidate proposals and proposes to the Supervisory Board of the Company suitable candidates for its election proposals to the General Meeting. In the past fiscal year, the Nomination Committee convened two times, in particular to prepare the proposals for the election of the members of the Supervisory Board by the Annual General Meeting 2021. Joint Committee The Company has a Joint Committee which is composed of two members of the supervisory board of the General Partner as well as two members of the Supervisory Board of the Company. For certain matters, the Management Board requires the approval of the Joint Committee. In the past fiscal year, the Joint Committee did not convene since no meeting was required. Special Joint Committee In 2019, the Supervisory Board of the Company and the Super- visory Board of the General Partner had constituted a special joint committee (Special Joint Committee). Within the scope of the responsibilities of the Supervisory Board, the Special Joint Committee was to review any conse- quences of the findings from the Companys agreements with the DoJ and the SEC in 2019 and to make recommendations to the Supervisory Board. The Special Joint Committee convened three times in the year under review. The Chairman of the Spe- cial Joint Committee has regularly informed the Supervisory Board of the Company. The Special Joint Committee within the scope of its review con- cluded that the findings of the aforementioned agreements do not indicate that any action beyond the review by the Supervi- sory Board is warranted. Following its own review, the Supervisory Board concurred with this conclusion and resolved that on the basis of the facts avail- able to it in connection with the findings of the aforementioned agreements, no measures are to be initiated that fall within its responsibility. The Special Joint Committee was dissolved by resolution of the Supervisory Board of the Company and of the supervisory board of the General Partner on November 30, 2020 upon com- pletion of the task for which it had been formed. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The members of the Supervisory Board in principle self-respon- sibly undertake educational and training measures required for their tasks, such as on changes in the legal framework and on new, future-oriented developments technologies, and are ade- quately supported in this respect by the Company. In addition to the information provided to them by various external experts, also experts of the Companys departments regularly report on relevant developments, such as - for exam- ple - relevant new developments in the revision of legal rules or in jurisprudence and also about recent developments in regula- tions on accounting and audit. In this way, the Supervisory Board, with the Companys adequate assistance, ensures an ongoing qualification of its members and also a further devel- opment and updating of their expertise, power of judgment and experience, which is required for the Supervisory Board includ- ing its committees to duly perform their tasks. New members of the Supervisory Board can meet the members of the Management Board and specialist managers for a discus- sion of fundamental and current topics and thereby gain an overview of the relevant topics of the company (onboarding). For targeted further training, internal information events are offered as required. In the reporting year, further training was provided for the members of the Supervisory Board on the pro- visions of the FCPA and on a regular basis on current develop- ments in corporate governance and upcoming relevant legal regulations. In the reporting year, this included developments in corporate and capital market law and reimbursement in rele- vant healthcare systems. The Supervisory Board reports to the General Meeting on pos- sible conflicts of interests of its members and on the treatment of such conflicts. In the year under review, there were no con- flicts of interest of board members that would have been required to be disclosed to the Supervisory Board and of which the Supervisory Board would inform the General Meeting. Further details on corporate governance, in particular on the independence of the Supervisory Board members, on the mem- bership in the supervisory boards of the General Partner, Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA or the latters general partner, the pro- file of skills and expertise for the Supervisory Board and the age limit for membership in the Companys Supervisory Board, as well as the self-assessment of the activities of the Supervi- sory Board and its committees, can be found in the Declaration on Corporate Governance starting ON page 109. The Declara- tion on Corporate Governance was discussed by the Super- visory Board and approved in its meeting of March 9, 2021. The Declaration on Corporate Governance also includes the Declaration of Compliance in relation to the German Corporate Governance Code according to Sec. 161 AktG as resolved by the Management Board and Supervisory Board and published in December 2020. The Declaration of Compliance is permanently available to the public on the Companys website www. freseniusmedicalcare.com/en in the section Investors and there in the sub-section Corporate Governance. The update to the Declaration of Compliance resolved by the Management Board and the Supervisory Board in February 2021 can be found there, too. ANNUAL AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The annual financial statements and the management report of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA were prepared in accordance with the regulations of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The consolidated financial statements and group management report follow Sec. 315e of the German Commer- cial Code (HGB) in accordance with IFRS as applicable in the European Union. Accountancy, the annual financial statements, the management report as well as the consolidated financial statements and the group management report for fiscal year 2020 were audited by Pricewaterhouse Coopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main. Said com- pany was elected as auditor by resolution of the Annual Gen- eral Meeting of August 27, 2020 and mandated by the Supervi- sory Board. The auditor provided each of the aforementioned documents with an unqualified certificate. Mr. Peter Kartscher and Mr. Holger Lutz signed the respective audit certificate as the responsible auditors. The audit reports of the auditor were made available to the Audit and Corporate Governance Com- mittee and the Supervisory Board. The Audit and Corporate Governance Committee reviewed the annual and consolidated financial statements as well as the management reports and included the audit reports of, and the discussions with, the auditor in its discussions. The Audit and Corporate Governance Committee reported to the Supervisory Board on this. The Supervisory Board also reviewed the annual financial statements, the management report, the consolidated financial statements and the group management report in each case for the past fiscal year. The documents were provided to it in good time. The Supervisory Board declared its agreement with the result of the audit of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements by the auditor. The represen- tatives of the auditor who signed the audit reports participated in the discussions of the Supervisory Board of the annual and consolidated financial statements. They reported to the Super- visory Board on the significant findings of their audit and were available for additional information. Also according to the final results of its own review, no objections are to be raised by the Supervisory Board as regards the annual financial statements, the management report, the consolidated financial statements and the group management report. In its meeting on February 22, 2021 the Supervisory Board discussed the draft of the report according to Form 20-F. The report according to Form 20-F was filed with the SEC on February 23, 2021. The annual financial statements and management report of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA as well as the consoli- dated financial statements and the group management report for the past fiscal year, as presented by the General Partner, were approved by the Supervisory Board at its meeting on March 9, 2021. The Supervisory Board also approved the General Partners proposal for the application of profit which provides for a divi- dend of  1.34 for each share. SEPARATE NON-FINANCIAL GROUP REPORT The separate non-financial group report of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA was prepared in accordance with the regu- lations of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and will be pub- lished separately from the management report. Fresenius Med- ical Care therein reports selected non-financial information in reference to the international sustainability standard of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) (GRI Standards 2016). The Supervisory Board made use of the option to have the separate non-financial group report verified by an external auditor. The separate non-financial group report was subjected to a limited assurance engagement review by Pricewaterhouse- Coopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, in accordance with the international standard on assur- ance engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised). Pricewaterhouse- Coopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft issued a cor- responding assurance statement. The Supervisory Board reviewed the separate non-financial group report. The documents were provided to it in good time. The Supervisory Board declared its agreement with the result of the limited assurance engagement by the auditor.

KGaA, for the election of the auditor of the annual financial statements. limited by shares consisting of a management body and a supervisory board. The business activities of a partnership lim- ited by shares are conducted by one or several personally liable shareholders (General Partner). In the case of FMC AG & Co. KGaA, this is Fresenius Medical Care Management AG. Its Man- agement Board is also responsible for conducting the business activities of the KGaA. Within the scope of statutory allocation of competences, the Supervisory Board is responsible for supervising and advising the Management Board and is involved in making decisions that are fundamental to the Com- pany. The duties and responsibilities of both bodies are in each case statutorily defined and are strictly separated from one another. Corresponding to FMC AG & Co. KGaA, Fresenius Med- ical Care Management AG has its own Supervisory Board. THE GENERAL PARTNER AND ITS BODIES The Management Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG The General Partner - Fresenius Medical Care Management AG - represented by its Management Board, which acts on its own responsibility, manages the Company and conducts the Companys business. Its actions and decisions are directed towards the interests of the Company. The Management Board of the General Partner manages the Companys business in accordance with the applicable laws and the Articles of Association as well as the rules of procedure within the meaning of section 77 para. 2 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The rules of procedure stipulate the principles of the cooperation and provide for the schedule of responsibilities which determines the departmental responsi- bilities of the individual Management Board members. The rules of procedure determine that meetings of the Manage- ment Board are held as the circumstances require, but at least twelve times a year. The meetings and the taking of resolutions by the Management Board are led by the Chairman of the Management Board. If he is unavailable, this task resides with the Management Board member named by the Chairman, or, if no member has been named, with the participating Manage- ment Board member most senior in office. The Chairman of the meeting determines the order of the agenda items and the mode of voting. In principle, the Management Board adopts resolutions at meetings by simple majority of votes cast, and outside the meetings by simple majority of its members. In case of a voting tie, the Chairman of the Management Board has the casting vote. In the year under review, the Management Board was com- posed of eight members. Mr. Franklin W. Maddux, MD, with effect as of January 1, 2020 was appointed as Global Chief Medical Officer as a member of the Management Board. The members of the Management Board and their areas of respon- sibility are introduced on the Companys website at www. freseniusmedicalcare.com in the About us section. Irrespective of the overall responsibility of the entire Manage- ment Board, each Management Board member is responsible for his or her own area of departmental responsibility. The Management Board members keep each other informed on an ongoing basis about all relevant business occurrences in their areas of departmental responsibility. In the case of inter- departmental matters, the Management Board members con- cerned are requested to coordinate with each other. The Chair- man of the Management Board coordinates the affairs of the individual departments. Matters of outstanding importance and significance are resolved on by the entire Management Board pursuant to the rules of procedure. In order to increase the efficiency of the Management Boards work, the Supervisory Board of the Gen- eral Partner established a Management Board Committee for certain cross departmental matters. If necessary, such Manage- ment Board Committee essentially deals with corporate mat- ters of subsidiaries of FMC AG & Co. KGaA or acquisitions that do not reach the minimum relevance and importance level required for being referred to the entire Management Board. The Management Board Committee must be composed of at least three members, among them the Chairman of the Man- agement Board and the Chief Financial Officer as well as the Management Board member responsible for the respective matter or another Management Board member appointed by the Chairman at his reasonable discretion exercised in each case. In its meetings the Management Board Committee decides with a simple majority of the votes cast; outside of meetings the Management Board Committee decides with the simple majority of its members. In various relevant cases, the rules of procedure require the Management Board to obtain the prior approval of the Supervi- sory Board or the competent committee of the Supervisory Board of the General Partner. The Supervisory Board of the General Partner has resolved an age limit for the Management Board members. Management Board members of the General Partner who have reached the age of 65 years shall, as a rule, retire from the Management Board at the end of such calendar year. The Supervisory Board of the General Partner will take this age limit into account for each appointment of Management Board mem- bers. The age limit for the Management Board members of the General Partner does not apply to the current term of office of Mr. Rice Powell. The Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG As a stock corporation, Fresenius Medical Care Management AG has its own Supervisory Board, which according to its Arti- cles of Association consists of six members. Mr. Stephan Sturm has been appointed as Chairman. Other members of the Super- visory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG in the year under review were Dr. Dieter Schenk (Vice Chairman), Mr. Rolf A. Classon, Ms. Rachel Empey, Mr. William P. Johnston and Dr. Gerd Krick. Dr. Dieter Schenk, Mr. Rolf A. Classon and Mr. William P. John- ston are at the same time members of the Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA.

The Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG appoints the members of the Management Board and supervises and advises the Management Board in its manage- ment responsibilities. The Supervisory Board has established rules of procedure. Irrespective of the independence requirements according to statutory rules and of the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in its respectively applicable form, the so-called Pooling Agreement entered into, among others, between Fresenius Medical Care Management AG and Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA provides that at least one third (and at least two) of the members of the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG must be independent members. Pursu- ant to the Pooling Agreement, an independent member is a member of the Supervisory Board with no substantial business or professional relationship with FMC AG & Co. KGaA, with its General Partner (Fresenius Medical Care Management AG), with Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA, or with its General Partner (Fresenius Management SE), or with any affiliates of these companies. Independent within the meaning of this definition are the Supervisory Board members Mr. Rolf A. Classon and Mr. William P. Johnston, as well as also the members of the Super- visory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA Dr. Dorothea Wenzel, Ms. Pascale Witz and Professor Dr. Gregor Zund, who are not at the same time members of the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG. Committees of the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG From the midst of its members, the Supervisory Board forms qualified committees for the efficient exercise of its responsi- bilities, which prepare the matters for deliberation and resolu- tions of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board regu- larly and timely receives briefings on the committees work - See TaBLe 4.3 ON page 112. SUPERVISORY BOARD OF THE COMPANY The Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA advises and supervises the business activities as conducted by the General Partner and performs the other duties assigned to it by law and by the Articles of Association. It is involved in strategy and planning as well as all matters of fundamental importance for the Company.

The profile of skills and expertise contains requirements for the individual Supervisory Board members as well as requirements for the entire Supervisory Board and is available on the Companys website at www.freseniusmedicalcare.com in the About us section. When discussing its recommendations for the election of mem- bers of the Supervisory Board to the General Meeting, the Supervisory Board considers, within the framework of the pro- file of skills and expertise as determined by it, in particular the international activities of the enterprise, what it considers to review, the Supervisory Board did not include any members who previously were also members of the Management Board of the General Partner. The members of the Companys Super- visory Board are independent in their decisions and are not bound by requirements or instructions of third parties. Composition The Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA consisted in the year under review of the following members: Dr. Dieter Schenk (Chairman), Mr. Rolf A. Classon (Vice Chairman), Mr. William P. Johnston, Dr. Dorothea Wenzel, Ms. Pascale Witz and Professor Dr. Gregor Zund. The members of the Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA are introduced on the Companys website at www.freseniusmedicalcare.com in the About us section. There is also information on their term of office on the Compa- nys Supervisory Board. Because of his extraordinary contributions to the Companys development and his comprehensive experience, Dr. Ben Lipps is also honorary chairman of the Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA. All members of the Companys Supervisory Board are elected by the General Meeting of FMC AG & Co. KGaA as the compe- tent election body according to the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act by a simple majority of the votes cast. Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA is excluded from voting on this issue be an adequate number of independent Supervisory Board members, and diversity. Pursuant to the profile of skills and expertise the Supervisory Board is in accordance with section 111 para. 5 German Stock Corporation Act to be composed of at least 30 % women and at least 30 % of men. Two of the six Supervisory Board members are female. The proportion of female Supervisory Board members thus exceeds the Supervi- sory Boards self-defined target of 30 % at the end of the year under review (see also section Gender diversity and targets starting on page 116). The Supervisory Board has further resolved an age limit for the Supervisory Board members. The Supervisory Board shall, as a rule, only include persons who have not reached the age of 75 years at the time of their elec- tion or appointment. The Supervisory Board will observe this age limit in its election proposals for membership in the Super- visory Board. The current composition of the Supervisory Board is in line with the profile of skills and expertise for the Supervisory Board and fulfills the objectives for the composi- tion of the board designated therein. Independence According to the recommendation C.7 of the Code 2020, more than half of the members of the Supervisory Board shall be inde- pendent from the Company and the Management Board. Mem- bers of the Supervisory Board are to be considered independent from the Company and its Management Board if they have no personal or business relationship with the Company or its Man- agement Board that may cause a substantial - and not merely temporary - conflict of interest. When assessing the indepen- dence of members of the Supervisory Board from the Company and its Management Board, the Supervisory Board shall particu- larly take into consideration whether the respective member of the Supervisory Board member itself or a close family member was a member of the Companys Management Board in the two years prior to appointment, is currently maintaining (or has maintained) a material business relationship with the Company or one of the entities dependent upon the company in the year up to his / her appointment, directly or as a shareholder, or in a leading position of a non-group entity, or is a close family mem- ber of a Management Board member, or has been a member of the Supervisory Board for more than twelve years. The Supervisory Board has resolved that at least four of its members shall be independent within the meaning of the Code 2020. Independent within the meaning of the recommendation C.7 of the Code 2020 are, in the view of the Supervisory Board, in any case Mr. Rolf A. Classon, Dr. Dorothea Wenzel, Ms. Pascale Witz and Professor Dr. Gregor Zund. The Supervisory Board did not need to consider the question of whether Dr. Dieter Schenk and Mr. William P. Johnston are to be regarded as independent within the meaning of the recommendation C.7 of the Code 2020 in view of their term of office on the Supervisory Board of the Company of more than twelve years, because the number of those Supervisory Board members who have been members of the Supervisory Board for no more than twelve years and are otherwise to be qualified as independent already complies with the recommendation C.7 of the Code 2020. The recommendation C.9 of the Code 2020, according to which, in the event that the Company has a controlling share- holder within the meaning of the Code 2020, in the case of a Supervisory Board with six or fewer members at least one shareholder representative shall be independent of the con- trolling shareholder, does not apply to the Company, because Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA is no controlling shareholder in this meaning given the lack of a sustainable majority at the Annual General Meeting. However, assuming the applicability of this recommendation, Mr. Classon, Mr. Johnston, Dr. Wenzel, Ms. Witz and Professor Dr. Zund would be considered independent in this meaning. The term of office of the members of the Supervisory Board is in principle five years. The current term of office of the incumbent members of the Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA ends at the end of the General Meeting that resolves on the discharge for the fiscal year 2020, i.e. at the end of the Annual General Meeting 2021. It is intended to propose to the Annual General Meeting 2021 to elect the members of the Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA for a term of office of only four years. Rules of Procedure Details on the election, constitution and term of office of the Supervisory Board, its meetings and the adoption of resolu- tions, as well as its rights and obligations, are set out in the Companys Articles of Association available on the Companys website at www.freseniusmedicalcare.com in the Investors section. In accordance with the recommendation D.1 of the Code 2020, the Supervisory Board has furthermore adopted rules of procedure which set out, among other things, the modalities for convening meetings and the manner in which resolutions are adopted. In accordance with these, the Super- visory Board meets regularly at least twice per calendar half year. The convocation period for meetings of the Supervisory Board is generally two weeks. The deliberations of the Super- visory Board are conducted by the Chairman or, if the latter is unavailable, by the Vice Chairman. The Chairman of the meet- ing also determines the order of the agenda items and the mode of voting. As a rule, the Supervisory Board decides by simple majority of votes cast if decisions are taken in physical meetings and otherwise with the simple majority of its mem- bers, unless other majorities are prescribed by a mandatory provision of law in the individual case. The provisions of the rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board of the Company also apply to its committees, unless their rules of procedure contain deviating provisions. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board coordinates the work and direction of the Supervisory Board; he also represents the Supervisory Board vis-a-vis third parties. The rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board of the Company are publicly available on the Companys website at www.freseniusmedicalcare.com in the section About us in the sub-section Supervisory Board. Self-assessments In accordance with the recommendation D.13 of the Code 2020, the members of the Supervisory Board regularly carry out self-assessments with regard to their work. These take place in the form of open discussions in plenary meetings, based on a corresponding questionnaire. On these annual occasions, also the complexity and the design of the presentations, as well as the meetings procedure and structuring are discussed. If nec- essary, the Supervisory Board may seek the assistance of an external service provider for its self-assessment. The results of the self-assessment carried out have shown that each of the Supervisory Board and its committees are efficiently organized and that the cooperation of the Supervisory Board and the Management Boards works very well. Professional competence All members of the Supervisory Board have the capabilities as well as the knowledge required for the proper exercise of their duties. The Supervisory Board members are in their entirety familiar with the sector FMC AG & Co. KGaA operates in. The members of the Supervisory Board regularly update them- selves via in-house sources and via external sources about the current status of supervisory requirements. Details of the sup- port provided by the Company to the members of the Supervi- sory Board for their induction into office and for their training and development measures can be found in the Report by the Supervisory Board starting on page 103.

Audit and Corporate Governance Committee With the consent of the Supervisory Board, the Audit and Cor- porate Governance Committee adopted rules of procedure. On the basis of the relevant provisions of the Articles of Associa- tion of the Company (section 12 para. 2) they define the compo- sition as well as the work and tasks of the Audit and Corporate Governance Committee. According to these, the Audit and Cor- porate Governance Committee shall consist of at least three and not more than five exclusively independent members who, in particular, are to meet the criteria of independence pursuant to section 12 para. 2 sentence 3 of the Articles of Association as well as pursuant to the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, pursuant to section 107 para. 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act in connection with section 100 para. 5 of the German Stock Corporation Act at least one mem- ber must have expertise in the fields of accounting or auditing. Moreover, in accordance with the recommendations of the Code 2020 the Chairman of the Audit and Corporate Gover- nance Committee is neither Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Company at the same time nor a former member of the Management Board whose appointment has ended less than two years ago.

For preparation of any nomination proposal, the respective competent governance Special Joint Committee Further there was a special joint committee (Special Joint Com- mittee) until November 30, 2020. Said committee was formed from of one member of the Supervisory Board of the Company, one member of the Supervisory Board of the General Partner, and one member of both afore-mentioned Supervisory Boards. The Special Joint Committee was, within the scope of the responsibilities of the Supervisory Board, to review any conse- quences of the findings of the agreements concluded by the Company with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2019 and make recommendations to the Supervisory Board - See TaBLe 4.6. Further information to this can be found in the Report of the Supervisory Board starting on page 103. DIVERSITY AND TARGETS Diversity concept for governance bodies Fresenius Medical Care highly values inclusion and diversity both for its governance bodies as well as its overall workforce, and considers this as a strength of the enterprise. A high degree of inclusion and diversity in the composition of the gov- ernance bodies and the workforce is one of Fresenius Medical Cares core objectives and is in the interest of the Company body or the competent committee, as the case may be, thor- oughly evaluates the current composition of the governance body to be filled and carefully analyzes each potential candi- dates profile with regard to the diversity criteria. Further diversity is actively managed in senior management levels below the Management Board. To this end, diversity aspects such as gender are particularly taken into account in the evaluation of the talent pipelines. Additional reports, for example on the number and share of female junior talents in talent evaluation and the succession planning process, support the focus on diversity in development planning and the prepa- ration for filling vacancies. This serves to strengthen the pur- sued diversity concept and to identify suitable talents at an early stage. The current diversity level of the Management Board of the General Partner and Supervisory Board of the Company across selected aspects is displayed in the TaBLeS 4.7 aND 4.8. Gender diversity and targets The Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA is obliged to define targets for the representation of female members in the Supervisory Board as well as an implementation period and to report on the defined targets and their achievement during the relevant reference period or in the event of a failure to meet these targets, on the reasons for this, as part of the declaration on corporate governance. The definition of targets for the com- position of the Management Board is for companies which, like Fresenius Medical Care, are organized in the legal form of a partnership limited by shares, is by contrast expressly not required. Likewise, also the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG is not required to define targets for the Management Board, because Fresenius Medical Care Management AG is not in the scope of the relevant legal provi- sions. With two of in total eight members of the Management Board in the year under review being female, the share of women in the Management Board of Fresenius Management AG amounted to 25 % in the year under review.

KGaA has resolved on May 10, 2017 to set the target for the representation of female Supervisory Board members at 30 % and has set an implemen- tation period ending on May 9, 2022. With two female members (33 %), the composition of the Supervisory Board in the year under review was in line with this target. Pursuant to the Act on Equal Participation of Women and Men in Leadership Positions, the Management Board is obliged to determine targets for female representation in the two top management levels below the Management Board as well as an appropriate implementation period. In a first step, the Manage- ment Board on September 28, 2015, had resolved to define the two top management levels below the Management Board in relation to the participation of executives in the group-wide Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP). In a second step, the Man- agement Board resolved on January 13, 2016 upon targets for female representation for the two top management levels below the Management Board and upon the implementation period to end on December 31, 2020. Notwithstanding the determination of these two management levels, the best indi- cator for Fresenius Medical Care for women holding manage- ment positions worldwide is the total number of participants in the group-wide LTIP. Compared with 2018, the share of women in these management positions slightly increased and amounted to around 34.3 % at the end of the year under review (2019: 34 %). The first management level included all managers worldwide who directly report to a member of the Management Board and participate in the LTIP. The respective target that was to be achieved by end of the implementation period on December 31, 2020 is 18.8 %. The share of female executives as of Decem- ber 31, 2020 was 21.5 % (2019: 23.0 %). Hence, the target has been surpassed by the Company. The second management level included all managers world- wide who directly report to a management executive of the first management level and participate in the LTIP. The respec- tive target that was to be achieved by end of the implementa- tion period on December 31, 2020 is 28.2 %. The share of female managers as of December 31, 2020 was 31 % (2019: 29.7 %). The defined target, thus, has also been surpassed for this management level. In the year under review, the Management Board has deter- mined new targets for female representation in the two top management levels below the Management Board and the respective new implementation periods. In this context, the definition of the two management levels below the Board of Management for which targets are to be set has also been adjusted. The positions of the first and second management levels are now determined on the basis of a global job evalua- tion system considering criteria such as impact and contribu- tion of the position as well as required skills relating to commu- nication, innovation and knowledge. The target figure for the first management level to be achieved by the end of the imple- mentation period on December 31, 2025 has been increased compared with the previous target figure and is now 22 %. At the end of the year under review, 18.3 % of managers in this first management level were female. The target figure for the second management level to be achieved by the end of the implementation period on December 31, 2025 has also been increased compared with the previous target figure and is now 32 %. At the end of the year under review, 28.3 % of managers in this second management level were female. Overall, the recruiting and staffing practice of Fresenius Medical Care as well as the selection decisions regarding the hiring and promotion to top management levels will also in the future be taken with a focus on the specific qualifications of the individ- ual. For this reason, the Management Board will select candi- dates for the top management of Fresenius Medical Care according to the candidates excellence and suitability for the specific role and function in such management positions, regardless of their race, gender or other non-performance related attributes. However, the number and proportion of female Supervisory Board members and Management Board members, the continuous achievement and increase of our diversity targets as well as the programmatic support within the sustainability efforts demonstrate the priority of diversity for Fresenius Medical Care. LONG-TERM SUCCESSION PLANNING Together with the Management Board of the General Partner, the Supervisory Board of the General Partner takes care for the long-term succession planning. For this purpose, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the General Partner liaises with the respective members of the Management Board sufficiently in advance and, as a rule, not later than one year before the end of the respective term of office about their willingness to con- tinue their respective mandate. In addition, the Supervisory Board of the General Partner continuously reviews whether the Management Board of the General Partner continues to be composed in the best possible way. To this end, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the General Partner discusses with the Chairman of the Management Board, in particular, what knowledge, experience and professional as well as personal competencies in the Management Board of the General Partner should be represented also with regard to the strategic development of the Company and a possible changing regula- tory environment and to what extent the Management Board of the General Partner is already staffed in accordance with these requirements. If there is need for action with regard to the composition of the Management Board, potential internal or external candidates for the corresponding addition to the Management Board are identified. For the identification of suitable external candidates, the Supervisory Board of the General Partner also obtains the support of external consultants, where necessary. When evalu- ating suitable candidates, not only their individual knowledge and experience, but also their personality and its added value to the Management Board is taken into account. With the com- position of the Management Board, a cooperative working envi- ronment across all departments and in the interest of the entire Company shall be created that not only allows but rather also promotes constructive criticism. The Chairman of the Manage- ment Board of the General Partner is closely involved in the entire selection process. The Supervisory Board of the General Partner pays attention to diversity in the composition of the Management Board. COMPLIANCE Global business activities mean having global responsibility. As the global market leader in providing dialysis services and products, Fresenius Medical Care is aware of its responsibility. Every day, Fresenius Medical Care strives to improve the lives of its patients worldwide with high-quality products and services. Fresenius Medical Care takes the highest medical standards as benchmark for quality. Fresenius Medical Care is committed to conducting its business activities in compliance with all rele- vant legal standards as well as internal and external provisions and requirements. The patients, customers, payors, investors and regulators of Fresenius Medical Care as well as all other stakeholders expect Fresenius Medical Cares business to be conducted based on responsible management, taking into account integrity, sound corporate governance and adherence to compliance principles. Fresenius Medical Cares Code of Ethics and Business Conduct Fresenius Medical Cares Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is the basis for everything Fresenius Medical Care and its employees do, whether in their dealings with patients, col- leagues and suppliers or with a view to communities in general. The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct defines corporate governance practices beyond the legal requirements. It covers Fresenius Medical Cares material non-financial topics such as patient care, quality and innovation, anti-corruption, worker protection, environment, health and safety, as well as non-dis- crimination. The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct together with the underlying corporate core values also includes Fresenius Medical Cares commitment to respecting human rights. It applies to every function and division worldwide, to every employee of Fresenius Medical Care, and to the Compa- nys direct and indirect majority-owned or controlled affiliates anywhere in the world. Employees must adhere to the princi- ples in the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is publicly available on the Com- panys website at www.freseniusmedicalcare.com in the section About us in the sub-section Compliance. Ensuring compliance Compliance with the rules is essential for the long-term suc- cess of Fresenius Medical Care as it determines the corporate culture and is an integral part of day-to-day work. Specialized functions at a global, regional and local level have the respon- sibility to implement and communicate these principles and core values within the organization. Code of Ethics and Busi- ness Conduct training programs increase awareness and an understanding of the applicable rules and help employees com- ply with these rules. These are held regularly and are manda- tory for all relevant employees. There are processes in place to enable employees to take part in the courses. Fresenius Medical Care fosters an open working atmosphere and therefore encourages its employees to question everything that does not comply with the rules and to report any indica- tions of possible violations to their superiors or the Compli- ance, Legal or Human Resources departments. In addition, both Fresenius Medical Care employees and external parties can anonymously (to the extent permitted by law) report sus- pected unethical or inappropriate business practices of employ- ees via a hotline - the Compliance Action Line - and via appro- priate e-mail addresses. In accordance with Fresenius Medical Cares policy, there must be no negative consequences for whistleblowers if they have made the report in good faith. The Company has made and continues to make further signifi- cant investments in its compliance and financial controls and in its compliance, legal and financial organizations. The Company is fully committed to compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws. Further information regarding the investigations in con- nection with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and regarding the settlements reached with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Department of Jus- tice (DoJ) in 2019 can be found on page 70. RISK AND OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT At Fresenius Medical Care, an integrated management system is in place to ensure that risks and opportunities are already identified at an early stage, optimizing the risk profile and min- imizing the costs potentially related to the occurrence of risks through timely intervention. Fresenius Medical Cares risk man- agement is therefore an important component of the corporate management of Fresenius Medical Care. The adequateness and effectiveness of the internal control systems of Fresenius Med- ical Care for the financial reporting are reviewed on a regular basis by the Management Board and by Fresenius Medical Cares auditor. Further information about the risk and opportunity manage- ment system can be found in the Risks and opportunities report starting on page 62. GERMAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE AND DECLARATION OF COMPLIANCE The objective of the German Corporate Governance Code is to make the dual German corporate governance system transpar- ent and understandable. The Code includes principles, recom- mendations and suggestions governing the management and monitoring of German listed companies that are accepted nationally and internationally as standards of good and respon- sible governance. It aims to promote confidence in the manage- ment and supervision of German listed companies by investors, customers, employees and the general public. The Management Board of Fresenius Medical Care Manage- ment AG and the Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA endorse the standards set forth in the German Corporate Gov- ernance Code. The vast majority of the recommendations and suggestions in the Code have been an integral and active part of Fresenius Medical Cares day-to-day operations since the founding of the Company. The current annually required Declaration of Compliance according to section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act issued by the Management Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG and the Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA as of December 2020 as well as the update to this Decla- ration of Compliance resolved by the Management Board and the Supervisory Board in February 2021 are reported hereinaf- ter. They and previous Declarations of Compliance and other extensive information on corporate governance are perma- nently made publicly available on the Companys website at www.freseniusmedicalcare.com in the Investors section. Declaration by the Management Board of the general partner of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA, Fresenius Medical Care Management AG, and by the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA on the German Corporate Governance Code pursuant to Section 161 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) The Management Board of Fresenius Medical Care Manage- ment AG (hereafter: the Management Board), as the general partner of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA, and the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA declare that since issuance of the previous declaration of com- pliance in December 2019 the recommendations of the Ger- man Corporate Governance Code Government Commission published by the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Pro- tection in the official section of the Federal Gazette (hereafter: the Code) in the version of February 7, 2017 were met and in the version of December 16, 2019 will be met in the future. Only the following recommendations of the Code in its version of Febru- ary 7, 2017 and in its version of December 16, 2019 have not been met or will not be met to the extent described below: A. Code in the version of February 7, 2017 Code number 4.2.3 paragraph 2 sentence 6: Caps regarding specific compensation amounts Pursuant to Code number 4.2.3 paragraph 2 sentence 6, the amount of compensation for Management Board members shall be capped, both overall and for variable compensation components. This recommendation was not met. The service agreements with members of the Management Board did not provide for caps regarding specific amounts for all compensation compo- nents and accordingly not for caps regarding specific amounts for the overall compensation. The performance-oriented short- term compensation (the variable bonus) was already capped. As regards stock options, phantom stock and performance shares as compensation components with long-term incen- tives, the service agreements with members of the Manage- ment Board did provide for a possibility of limitation but not for caps regarding specific amounts. Introducing caps regarding specific amounts in relation to such stock-based compensation components would have contradicted the basic idea pursued at that time of the members of the Management Board participat- ing in the economic risks and opportunities of the company without such a restriction. With the entry into force of the compensation system for the members of the Management Board of the general partner, which was approved by the ordinary General Meeting of the Company on August 27, 2020 (the Compensation System 2020+) and implemented in the service agreements with the Management Board members, caps were also introduced for the stock-based compensation components with long-term incentives as well as a maximum compensation with specific amounts, each effective January 1, 2020. Code number 4.2.3 paragraph 4: Severance payment cap Pursuant to Code number 4.2.3 paragraph 4, in concluding Management Board contracts, care shall be taken to ensure that payments made to a Management Board member on pre- mature termination of his / her contract, including fringe bene- fits, do not exceed the value of two years compensation (sever- ance payment cap) and compensate no more than the remaining term of the service agreements. The severance pay- ment cap shall be calculated on the basis of the total compen- sation for the past full financial year and if appropriate also the expected total compensation for the current financial year. These recommendations were not met for the time until December 31, 2019 insofar as the service agreements of the members of the Management Board did partially not contain severance payment arrangements for each case of premature termination of the contract and consequentially did not contain a limitation of any severance payment amount insofar, because this would not in every case have done justice to the assess- ment of each individual case considered preferable at the time. The Management Board contracts affected by this deviation were adjusted with effect from January 1, 2020. The recom- mendation has since been complied with. Code number 4.2.5 paragraph 3: Presentation in the compensation report Pursuant to Code number 4.2.5 paragraph 3, the presentation of the compensation for each individual member of the Management Board in the compensation report shall inter alia present the maximum and minimum achievable compensation for variable compensation components by using corresponding model tables. Fresenius Medical Care, in deviation from Code number 4.2.3 paragraph 2 sentence 6, did not provide for caps regard- ing specific amounts for all variable compensation components and, therefore, did not provide for caps regarding specific amounts for the overall compensation. In this respect, the com- pensation report for the fiscal year 2019 could not fully meet the requirements of the Code. Code number 5.1.2 paragraph 2 sentence 3: Age limit for members of the Management Board Pursuant to Code number 5.1.2 paragraph 2 sentence 3, an age limit shall be specified for members of the Management Board. This recommendation was deviated from. Not considering cer- tain persons for the Management Board of the general partner solely on the basis of their age did not appear appropriate according to previous assessment. In its meeting on November 30, 2020, the competent Supervi- sory Board of the general partner resolved to specify an age limit for the members of the Management Board of the general partner, which is to be disclosed in the Declaration on Corpo- rate Governance. Code number 5.4.1 paragraph 2 and paragraph 4: Specification of concrete objectives regarding the com- position of the Supervisory Board and their consider- ation when making election proposals Pursuant to Code number 5.4.1 paragraph 2 and paragraph 4, the Supervisory Board shall specify concrete objectives regard- ing its composition and shall prepare a profile of skills and expertise for the entire Supervisory Board. Within the compa- ny-specific situation, the composition of the Supervisory Board shall reflect appropriately the international activities of the company, potential conflicts of interest, the number of indepen- dent Supervisory Board members within the meaning of Code number 5.4.2, an age limit and a regular limit to Supervisory Board members term of office, both to be specified, as well as diversity. Proposals by the Supervisory Board to the General Meeting shall take these targets into account, while simultane- ously aiming at fulfilling the profile of skills and expertise of the entire Supervisory Board. The status of the implementation shall be published in the Corporate Governance Report. These recommendations were partly not met. In the companys interest not to limit the selection of qualified candidates in a generalizing way, the Supervisory Board refrained from an age limit and from a duration limit on the term of office. In its meeting on November 30, 2020, the Supervisory Board resolved to specify an age limit for the members of the Super- visory Board, which is to be disclosed in the Declaration on Cor- porate Governance. B. Code in the version of December 16, 2019 Code recommendation C.10 Independence of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board Pursuant to Code recommendation C.10, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board shall be independent of the Company and the Management Board. As a precautionary measure, a deviation from this recommen- dation is declared with regard to the term of office of the Chair- man of the Supervisory Board, Dr. Dieter Schenk, on the Super- visory Board of the Company. Whether Dr. Schenk in view of his term of office on the Supervisory Board of the Company of more than 12 years is to be regarded as independent of the Company and the Management Board within the meaning of the Code in the version of December 16, 2019 did not need to be considered, because the number of those Supervisory Board members who have been members of the Supervisory Board for no more than 12 years and are otherwise to be qualified as independent already complies with the Code recommendation C.7, pursuant to which more than half of the shareholder repre- sentatives shall be independent of the Company and the Man- agement Board. Bad Homburg v.d. Hohe, December 2020 Management Board of the general partner of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA, Fresenius Medical Care Management AG, and Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA Update of the Declaration of Compliance by the Management Board of the general partner of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA, Fresenius Medical Care Manage- ment AG, and by the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA on the German Corporate Governance Code pursuant to Section 161 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) dated December 2020 The Management Board of Fresenius Medical Care Manage- ment AG (hereafter: the Management Board), as the general partner of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA (hereafter: the Company), and the Supervisory Board of the Company last issued a declaration of compliance on the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (hereafter: the Code) pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act in December 2020. This declaration is updated as follows: Code recommendation G.8 Pursuant to recommendation G.8 of the Code, subsequent changes to the target values or comparison parameters of the variable compensation of the members of the Management Board shall be excluded. For precautionary reasons, a deviation from this recommendation is declared. For the 2020 fiscal year, an impairment of goodwill and trade- names in the Latin America segment has materialized with an impact of almost EUR 195 million as a consequence of the mac- ro-economic downturn and increasing risk adjustment rates for several countries in Latin America. In particular to ensure the comparability of the underlying financial figures of the perfor- mance targets with the Companys operating performance and to adequately recognize the actual performance of the mem- bers of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board of the general partner - in accordance with the recommendation G.11 of the Code, pursuant to which the Supervisory Board shall have the possibility to account for extraordinary developments to an appropriate extent - has decided to disregard the Latin American impairment in question, which solely relates to the carrying amounts, when determining the relevant target achievement. In all other respects, the declaration of compliance of Decem- ber 2020 remains unaffected. Bad Homburg v.d. Hohe, February 2021 Management Board of the general partner of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA, Fresenius Medical Care Management AG, and Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA SHAREHOLDERS The shareholders of the Company exercise their rights and voting powers in the General Meeting. The share capital of FMC AG & Co. KGaA is divided exclusively into ordinary shares. Each share of FMC AG & Co. KGaA entitles the holder to one vote at the General Meeting. Shares with multiple or prefer- ence voting rights do not exist. As a matter of principle, the General Partner (as far as it would be a shareholder in the Company, which was not the case in the year under review) respectively, its sole shareholder, Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA, can exercise at the General Meeting the voting rights connected with the shares they hold in FMC AG & Co. KGaA. However, the General Partner and its sole shareholder are subject to various rules preventing them by law from voting on certain resolu- tions. These include, among others, the election of the Super- visory Board, formal approval of the actions of the General Partner and the members of the Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA, as well as the election of the auditor of the annual financial statements. This is to guarantee that the other share- holders in the partnership limited by shares (KGaA) can solely decide on these matters, particularly those concerning the control of the management. GENERAL MEETING Shareholders can exercise their voting rights at the General Meeting, by proxy via a representative of their choice or by a Company-nominated proxy acting on their instructions. Proxy voting instructions to a Company nominee can be issued before and during the General Meeting until the end of the general debate. The Annual General Meeting 2020 of FMC AG & Co. KGaA took place at the Companys offices in Bad Homburg v.d. Hohe (Ger- many) on August 27, 2020 and, against the background of the spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, was held as a virtual General Meeting without the physical presence of shareholders or their proxies. Approximately 79 % of the share capital was represented at the Annual General Meeting. At the Annual Gen- eral Meeting, resolutions were passed on the following topics:  approval of the annual financial statements for fiscal year 2019,  allocation of distributable profit,  approval of the actions of the General Partner for fiscal year 2019,  approval of the actions of the Supervisory Board for fiscal year 2019,  election of the auditor and consolidated group auditor for fiscal year 2020 as well as the auditor for the potential review of interim financial information,  resolution on the approval of the compensation system for the members of the Management Board of the General Partner,  resolution on the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board and on the amendment of Article 13 and Article 13e (3) of the Articles of Association,  resolution on the cancellation of the existing authorized capitals, on the creation of new authorized capitals including the possibility of the exclusion of subscription rights as well as on corresponding amendments to Article 4 (3) and (4) of the Articles of Association of the Company,  resolution on the amendment of Article 15 (1) sentence 2 of the Companys Articles of Association (Alignment with the German Stock Corporation Act as amended by the ARUG II). All documents and information on the Annual General Meeting are available on the Companys website at www.freseniusmedi- calcare.com in the Investors section. LEGAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMPANYS CORPORATE BODIES When making decisions and in connection with the tasks and activities performed by them, the members of the Manage- ment Board of the General Partner and of the Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA, as well as the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG, do not pursue personal interests or give unjustified advantages to other peo- ple. Any business dealings with the Company by members of the corporate bodies are to be disclosed to the Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA immediately and are subject to its approval, if necessary. The Supervisory Board reports to the General Meeting on possible conflicts of interests of its members and on the treatment of such conflicts. In the year under review, there were no conflicts of interest of board mem- bers that would have been required to be disclosed to the Supervisory Board and of which the Supervisory Board would inform the General Meeting. Mr. Rice Powell as the Chairman of Fresenius Medical Care Man- agement AGs Management Board is, with the approval of Fresenius Medical Care Management AGs Supervisory Board, at the same time a member of the Management Board of Fresenius Management SE. The member of the Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA Dr. Dieter Schenk (Chairman) is also member and Vice Chair- man of the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Man- agement AG and of the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Man- agement SE, the general partner of Fresenius SE & Co.

Classon are also mem- bers of the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Man- agement AG. During the year under review, consulting or other service rela- tionships between members of the Supervisory Board and the Company did not exist. MANAGERS TRANSACTIONS According to Article 19 of the Regulation (EU) No 596 / 2014 (Market Abuse Regulation), the members of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board as well as other persons dis- charging managerial responsibilities and all persons who are closely associated with the aforementioned persons shall notify the issuer of any subsequent transaction with shares in Fresenius Medical Care and additional related financial instru- ments conducted on their own account once a total amount of EUR 20,000 has been reached within a calendar year. The issuer is required to publish the respective information. The managers transactions undertaken in the year under review are, inter alia, published on the Companys website at www.freseniusmedicalcare.com in the Investors section. TRANSPARENCY OF REPORTING Fresenius Medical Care meets all applicable transparency and external reporting requirements imposed by chapter F of the Code 2020. Fresenius Medical Care attaches special impor- tance to informing its shareholders simultaneously and uni- formly about the Company in its regular financial reporting events. Ad hoc releases and the website of Fresenius Medical Care play an essential role in these efforts. They provide inves- tors and other interested persons equally with direct and timely access to the information Fresenius Medical Care releases. FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND AUDIT, STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING Fresenius Medical Care prepares consolidated financial state- ments and a group management report as well as interim con- solidated quarterly reports in accordance with the Interna- tional Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU as well as in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB). The financial reporting is based on these statements. The consolidated finan- cial statements are published within the first 90 days of the end of each fiscal year, and the consolidated quarterly reports within the first 45 days of the end of each quarter. The annual financial statements and the management report of FMC AG & Co. KGaA are prepared in accordance with the legal requirements of the German Commercial Code. The annual financial statements are decisive for the distribution of the annual profit. Moreover, an Annual Report of Fresenius Medical Care, which includes the consolidated financial statements and the group management report in accordance with IFRS and the German Commercial Code, is published each year. Fresenius Medical Cares shares are listed on the stock exchange in the U.S. (as so-called American Depositary Receipts) and in Germany. Fresenius Medical Care is therefore subject to a num- ber of regulations and recommendations regarding the manage- ment, administration and monitoring of the Company. On the one hand, in addition to mandatory requirements under stock corporation and commercial law, Fresenius Medical Care com- plies with the regulations of Deutsche Borse and adhere to most of the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code. On the other hand, being a non-U.S. company (a so-called foreign private issuer) Fresenius Medical Care is subject to the regulations connected to Fresenius Medical Cares listing in the U.S. Observance of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) and portions of the Corporate Governance Rules of the New York Stock Exchange in particular is required. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act includes provisions governing companies and their auditors and is aimed at improving financial reporting, ensuring auditor inde- pendence and implementing other matters. The extension of regulations for financial reporting and internal control systems is intended to increase the trust of investors and other parties interested in the Company. Fresenius Medical Care fully complies with the current requirements applicable to the Company. COMPENSATION OF THE MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD AND SUPERVISORY BOARD The Compensation Report for the year under review, the appli- cable compensation system for the members of the Manage- ment Board of the General Partner as approved by the Compa- nys General Meeting as well as the last resolution of the Companys General Meeting on the remuneration of the mem- bers of the Supervisory Board of the Company are made pub- licly available on the following Companys websites: www.freseniusmedicalcare.com/en/about-us/management- board/compensation www.freseniusmedicalcare.com/en/about-us/supervisory- board/remuneration The Compensation Report for the year under review is also reproduced in the following. COMPENSATION REPORT The Compensation Report of FMC AG & Co. KGaA summarizes the main elements of the system for the compensation of the members of the Management Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG, the General Partner of FMC AG & Co. KGaA, and in this regard especially explains the amounts and struc- ture of the compensation paid to the Management Board. Fur- thermore, the principles and the amount of the compensation of the Supervisory Board of the Company are described in the Compensation Report. C 4.9 COMPENSATION COMPONENTS GRANTED FOR THE FISCAL YEAR The compensation system for the members of the Manage- ment Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG was amended with effect as from January 1, 2020 in accordance with the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), as amended by the German Act Implementing the Second (EU) Shareholder Rights Directive, and approved by the Annual General Meeting of FMC AG & Co. KGaA on August 27, 2020 with a majority of more than 95 % of the votes cast (Compensation System 2020+). The details of the Compensation System 2020+ can be found on the Compa- nys website at www.freseniusmedicalcare.com/en/about-us/ management-board/compensation. The Compensation Sys- tem 2020+ was implemented effective as of January 1, 2020 in the service agreements of all Management Board members. The compensation of the Management Board members for the fiscal year was determined in accordance with the Com- pensation System 2020+. The Compensation Report is part of the Management Report and of the group management report of FMC AG & Co. KGaA as at December 31, 2020 and was prepared in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The Com- pensation Report also includes in section VI. Tables of the value of benefits granted and received compensation tables which correspond, to a large extent, to the structure and the form of the model tables of the German Corporate Governance Code in its previous version dated February 7, 2017, to allow for the comparability with the previous years figures. Compensation of the Management Board The Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Manage- ment AG is responsible for determining the compensation of the members of the Management Board. The Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG is assisted in this task by a personnel committee, the Human Resources Committee, a committee which is composed of individual members of the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG and which is also responsible for the tasks of a compensation committee. The Human Resources Commit- tee is composed of Mr. Stephan Sturm (Chairman), Dr. Gerd Krick (Vice Chairman), Mr. Rolf A. Classon, Mr. William P. John- ston and Dr. Dieter Schenk. The Compensation System 2020+ underlying the compensa- tion of the Management Board for the fiscal year was devel- oped with the support of external compensation experts. The objective of the Compensation System 2020+ is to enable the members of the Management Board to participate reasonably in a sustainable and long-term development of the Companys business and to reward them based on their duties and perfor- mance as well as their success in managing the Companys eco- nomic and financial position giving due regard to the peer envi- ronment and to make a significant contribution to implementing and further developing the business strategy. In order to assess the appropriateness of the compensation system and the individual compensation of the Management Board members, the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG conducts a horizontal review of compen- sation amounts and structures. The amounts of the target total direct compensation (base salary, target Short-Term Incentive amount and grant amount under the Long-Term Incentive) and the respective components granted to each member of the Management Board are compared to compensation market data of companies of a comparable sector, country-coverage and size. Additionally, the base salary as well as the target amounts of the variable compensation components of the Man- agement Board members are benchmarked against those of companies of relevant peer groups (these include DAX 30 com- panies as well as U.S. companies with comparable sector and size). For the fiscal year, the DAX 30 companies as of Decem- ber 31, 2019 and - depending on the specific tasks of the respective member of the Management Board - the following companies listed in the U.S. were used: Anthem Inc., Baxter International Inc., Boston Scientific Corporation, Cigna Corpo- ration, CVS Health Corporation, DaVita Inc., Encompass Health Corporation, Humana Inc., McKesson Corporation, Medtronic plc, and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated. The Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG also conducts a vertical review with respect to the compen- sation levels of the Companys employees when determining the compensation system and the compensation of the Man- agement Board members. The compensation of the Management Board is, as a whole, performance-based and geared to promoting sustainable and long-term corporate development. In accordance with the Com- pensation System 2020+, it was composed in the fiscal year of non-performance-based and performance-based components: 1. a non-performance-based compensation, consisting of fixed compensation components (base salary, fringe ben- efits and pension commitment) 2. a short-term performance-based compensation, which is a one-year variable compensation (Short-Term Incentive) 3. components with long-term incentive effects (multi-year variable compensation comprised of share-based compen- sation with cash settlement and stock options, the latter granted in previous fiscal years) (Long-Term Incentive). More information about the compensation components granted for the fiscal year is provided in CHaRT 4.9 ON page 124. Upon the introduction of the Compensation System 2020+, the composition of the compensation components for the Manage- ment Board members has changed. The grant amounts for vari- able, performance-based compensation components are each determined as a multiple of the base salary. The multiplier for the short-term performance-based compensation is 1.05 and the multiplier for the long-term performance-based compensa- tion is 1.35. This results in a long-term oriented compensation structure that is consistent for all Management Board mem- bers and less complex than the previous compensation system. Until 2019 under the previous compensation system, the Man- agement Board members were entitled to a part of their one- year variable compensation irrespective of the target achieve- ment. This entitlement was abolished upon the introduction of the Compensation System 2020+ and the respective amount has been included in the base salary. Consequently, the base salary of the Management Board members for the fiscal year, compared to the base salary for the year 2019, has increased accordingly. In addition, further adjustments of the base salary were necessary in individual cases to keep the target total direct compensation of the Management Board members for the fiscal year on a level comparable to that of the year 2019 and to avoid any reduction by the introduction of the Compen- sation System 2020+. For the Management Board members Mr. Rice Powell and Mr. William Valle, a regular salary review and adjustment has been carried out in addition to the conversion of the compensation system in the fiscal year. I. Fixed compensation components The fixed compensation granted to the Management Board members comprises a base salary, fringe benefits and - if indi- vidually agreed - a pension commitment. The base salary is paid in Germany or Hong Kong (applicable to Mr. Harry de Wit, who is resident in Hong Kong) in twelve equal monthly installments. To the extent the base salary is paid to members of the Management Board in the U.S., the payment is made in accordance with local customs in twenty-six equal installments. II. Variable compensation components The variable compensation components comprise a short-term performance-based compensation component (Short-Term Incentive) and a long-term performance-based compensation component (Long-Term Incentive) that includes a mandatory share ownership element. The target Short-Term Incentive amount equals 105 % (multiplier of 1.05) of the respective Man- agement Board members relevant base salary. The grant amount under the Long-Term Incentive equals 135 % (multi- plier of 1.35) of the respective Management Board members relevant base salary. More information about the variable compensation compo- nents granted under the Compensation System 2020+ in the fiscal year is provided in CHaRT 4.10. For the Short-Term Incentive, the target achievement and pay- out are capped at 120 % of the applicable target Short-Term Incentive amount. For the Long-Term Incentive, the target achievement is capped at 200 % for each grant. In addition, the proceeds from each grant of the Long-Term Incentive are capped at 400 % of the grant amount for each grant, thus also capping the opportunity to profit from the share price develop- ment in the applicable performance period. The Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG has also agreed on a cap option for the variable compensation compo- nents in the event of extraordinary developments. In addition, the members of the Management Board receive fringe benefits based on their service agreements. In the fiscal year these consisted mainly of the private use of company cars, special payments such as the payment of school fees, housing, rent and relocation supplements, reimbursement of air travel expenses, reimbursement of fees for the preparation of tax returns, reimbursement of charges, contributions to pension schemes (other than the pension commitments set out herein), contributions to accident, life and health insurance or other insurances as well as tax equalizations resulting from different tax rates applicable in Germany and, as the case may be, the country in which the Management Board member is personally liable to taxes. For details regarding the tax equalizations, please see section V. Miscellaneous. The pension commitments of the members of the Management Board are described in section IV. Commitments to members of the Management Board in the event of a termination of their appointment of this Compensation Report. C 4.10 VARIABLE COMPENSATION COMPONENTS GRANTED UNDER THE COMPENSATION SYSTEM 2020+ IN THE FISCAL YEAR SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE annual payment in cash after completion of the fiscal year Financial targets: Revenue, Operating Income and Net Income Non-financial targets: Sustainability Overall target achievement: 0  120 % LONG-TERM INCENTIVE (MB LTIP 2020) 1 performance Share plan with a performance period of three years Investment of the proceeds in Company shares acquired on the stock exchange with a holding period of at least one year Targets: Revenue growth, Net Income growth and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Overall target achievement: 0  200 % 1 Fresenius Medical Care Management Board Long-Term Incentive Plan 2020 In addition, individual members of the Management Board may receive a variable compensation for their Management Board activities from compensation components granted for previous fiscal years. The members of the Management Board were granted, for the last time, for the year 2019 the so-called Share Based Award to the extent that they were entitled to a one-year variable com- pensation under the compensation system applicable until December 31, 2019. The Share Based Award is the amount of the one-year variable compensation that under the compensa- tion system applicable until December 31, 2019 was to be con- verted into virtual shares of the Company not backed by equity of the Company as an amount to be deferred. The Share Based Award is attributable to the compensation components with long-term incentive effect. To the extent that members of the Management Board were entitled to a Share Based Award under the compensation sys- tem applicable until December 31, 2019, they can in principle receive a share-based compensation, at the earliest, after a period of three years following the respective allocation dates. The share-based compensation is paid in cash and its amount depends on the share price of FMC AG & Co. KGaA upon exer- cise. In special cases (e.g. occupational disability, retirement, non-renewal of expired service agreements by the company) a shorter period may apply. To the extent that members of the Management Board have been granted performance shares under the Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA Long-Term Incentive Plan 2016 (LTIP 2016) or the Fresenius Medical Care Management Board Long-Term Incentive Plan 2019 (MB LTIP 2019), they may under certain conditions - and, under the MB LTIP 2019, for the first time in 2023 - receive share-based compensation with cash settlement from these performance shares. Furthermore, under the Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA Long-Term Incentive Program 2011 (LTIP 2011) individual members of the Manage- ment Board may under certain conditions exercise previously granted stock options or receive a share-based compensation with cash settlement from Phantom Stock already granted. On the basis of the plan conditions of the MB LTIP 2020, the MB LTIP 2019 and the LTIP 2016 and in accordance with the service agreements concluded with the Management Board members, variable compensation components that have already been earned and paid may be reclaimed, in particular in case of relevant violations of internal guidelines or undutiful conduct (Clawback). Short-Term Incentive Under the Compensation System 2020+, the members of the Management Board are entitled to receive a Short-Term Incen- tive which may result in a cash payment. The Short-Term Incen- tive rewards the Management Board members for the Compa- nys performance in the relevant fiscal year. The Short-Term Incentive is linked to the achievement of three financial and one non-financial performance target. The target Short-Term Incentive amount to be granted to each member of the Management Board, which is paid out at a tar- get achievement level of 100 %, equals 105 % (multiplier of 1.05) of the Management Board members relevant base salary. The Short-Term Incentive is measured based on the achieve- ment of four performance targets: 20 % relate to Revenue, 20 % to Operating Income, 40 % to Net Income and 20 % to the achievement of specific and measurable sustainability cri- teria (see CHaRT 4.11 ON page 128). The underlying financial figures of the financial performance targets are determined at constant currency and are adjusted for certain effects in line with the specifications determined before the beginning of the performance period, e.g. the effects from certain acquisitions and divestments, to ensure compara- bility of the financial figures with the operational performance. For the fiscal year, an impairment of goodwill and tradenames in the Latin America Segment has materialized with an impact of 194,468 THOUS as a consequence of the macro-economic down-turn and increasing risk adjustment rates for several countries in the Latin America Segment. In particular to ensure the comparability of the underlying financial figures of the per- formance targets with the Companys operating performance and to adequately recognize the actual performance of the members of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG has decided to disre- gard the Latin America Segment impairment in question, which solely relates to the carrying amounts, when determining the relevant target achievement for the Short-Term Incentive. For Dr. Katarzyna Mazur-Hofsa (member of the Management Board responsible for the region Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA)), Mr. William Valle (member of the Management Board responsible for the region North America (NA)) and Mr. Harry de Wit (member of the Management Board responsible for the region Asia-Pacific (AP)), who are responsible for a particular region, the Revenue and the Operating Income relate to the relevant financial figures of the respective region. For Mr. Rice Powell and Mrs. Helen Giza as Management Board members with corporate group functions as well as for Dr. Olaf Schermeier (member of the Management Board responsible for Global Research and Development), Mr. Kent Wanzek (mem- ber of the Management Board responsible for Global Manu- facturing, Quality and Supply) and Mr. Franklin W. Maddux, MD (member of the Management Board and Global Chief Medical Officer) the Revenue and the Operating Income relate to the relevant financial figures of the Group. The Net Income target always relates to that of the Group. By measuring the perfor- mance targets on a regional as well as on a group level, both C 4.11 SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE Global function: CeO, CFO, global Chief Medical Officer, CeO global Manufacturing, Quality and Supply, and CeO global Research and Development Regional function: CeO North america, CeO europe, Middle east and africa, and CeO asia-pacific The achievement of the sustainability target is measured at the group level to ensure close collaboration across the Companys operating segments in the field of sustainability. For this pur- pose, eight material sustainability areas were defined: patients, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, employees, data privacy and security, human rights, supply chain, environment as well as occupational health and safety. The progress in each sustain- ability area is measured by the degree of implementation of pre-defined management concepts that include purpose, goals and objectives, responsibility and ownership, coverage, report- ing and communication, results and progress as well as policy, guideline and training. The eight sustainability areas and seven management concepts result in 56 sustainability criteria. For the period from 2020 to 2022, the yearly progress of the implementation of these sustainability criteria will be assessed by an external auditor and measured in two steps using an audited control and calculation model. 1 Depending on the Management Board members function the financial performance of the individual regions and that of the Group are reflected. The Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG has defined the target values of the underlying financial figures for each financial performance target that lead to a target achievement of 0 % (lower threshold), 50 %, 100 % and 120 % (cap). In addition to the financial performance targets, the Compen- sation System 2020+ has incorporated sustainability as a non-financial performance target of the short-term variable compensation. This performance target underlines the Compa- nys commitment to implement its Global Sustainability Pro- gram. The sustainability performance target is based on a qual- itatively measurable sustainability target that relates to various sustainability areas. The following applies for each performance target: If the lower target value is not exceeded, a target achievement of 0 % applies. If the upper target value is exceeded, a target achieve- ment of 120 % (cap) applies. If the actual financial or non-finan- cial figures lie between the respective target values for a target achievement of 0 % to 100 % or 100 % to 120 %, the target achievement is determined by linear interpolation. TaBLe 4.12 ON page 129 shows the target values applied in the fiscal year and their achievement for the financial targets. Within the control and calculation model, the degree of imple- mentation of these sustainability criteria is evaluated in a first step using a predefined questionnaire. For each question 0 points, 0.25 points, 0.5 points, 0.75 points or 1 point can be achieved depending on the degree of implementation. Based on the evaluation of the questionnaire, the score for each sus- tainability criterion is determined in a second step. The score for each sustainability criterion can also be 0 points, 0.25 points, 0.5 points, 0.75 points or 1 point. To calculate the achieved score for each sustainability criterion, the average of the points over the number of questions per sustainability criterion is cal- culated. If the thus calculated average deviates from the afore- mentioned scores, it is rounded down to the next lower score. For example, a score of 0.45 points would lead to a score of 0.25 points for a sustainability criterion. To determine the total score for the sustainability target, the sum of the points achieved for the 56 sustainability criteria is calculated. The Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG has set the following target values for the fis- cal year: A total score of 10.75 or less results in a target achieve- ment of 0 %, a total score of 18.00 results in a target achieve- ment of 100 % and a total score of 20.00 or more results in a target achievement of 120 %. The total score achieved in the fiscal year was 24.50. This resulted in a sustainability target achievement of 120 %. T 4.12 TARGET VALUES AND TARGET ACHIEVEMENT Target Values 1 Target achievement in the fiscal year The degree of the overall target achievement for the Short- Term Incentive is determined based on the weighted arithmetic mean of the target achievement of each performance target. Multiplying the degree of the respective overall target achieve- ment with the target Short-Term Incentive amount results in the final Short-Term Incentive amount. Subject to the approval by the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Manage- ment AG, the final Short-Term Incentive amount is paid to the respective Management Board member in cash. Since the over- all target achievement is capped at 120 %, the final Short-Term Incentive amount is also capped at 120 % of the respective tar- get Short-Term Incentive amount. TaBLe 4.13 shows the target achievement per performance tar- get as well as the overall target achievement of the individual Management Board members for the fiscal year. 1 The target values for a target achievement of 50 % follow from the linear interpolation for a target achievement between 0 % and 100 % and are therefore not listed separately.

The Share Based Award that is attributable to the components with long-term incentive effect was granted for the last time for the year 2019.

Based on this already fixed value, the allocation of the specific number of virtual shares made by the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG took place in March of the fiscal year on the basis of the then current price conditions of the shares of FMC AG & Co. KGaA. This number will also serve as multiplier for the share price on the applicable exercise date and, thus, as the basis for the determination of the payment amount of the respective share-based compensation. Long-Term Incentive Former member of the Management Board who resigned during the year 2019 5 1 Until 2019 under the previous compensation system, the Management Board members were entitled to a part of their one-year variable compensation irrespective of the target achievement. This entitlement was abolished upon the introduction of the Compensation System 2020+ and the respective amount has been included in the base salary. Consequently, the base salary of the Management Board members for the fiscal year, compared to the base salary for the year 2019, has increased accordingly. In addition, further adjustments of the base salary were necessary in individual cases to keep the target total direct compensation of the Management Board members for the fiscal year on a level comparable to that of the year 2019 and to avoid any reduction by the introduction of the Compensation System 2020+. For the Management Board members Mr. Rice Powell and Mr. William Valle, a regular salary review and adjustment has been carried out in addition to the conversion of the compensation system in the fiscal year. 2 Please note for purposes of comparison between the amounts indicated and those of the fiscal year that the compensation is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations depending on whether it is contractually denominated in euro (Mrs. Helen Giza and Dr. Katarzyna Mazur-Hofsa as well as Dr. Olaf Schermeier and Mr. Harry de Wit) or U.S. dollar (Messrs. Rice Powell, Franklin W. Maddux, MD, William Valle, Kent Wanzek and Michael Brosnan). The translation of U.S. dollar amounts was done at the average exchange rate for the applicable calendar year. 3 Please note for purposes of comparison of the amounts indicated for the fiscal year that Mrs. Helen Giza was appointed as member of the Management Board only with effect as of November 1, 2019 and Mr. Franklin W. Maddux, MD with effect as of January 1, 2020 and, therefore, they have received compensation payments to be set out herein in each case commencing only as of such respective dates. 4 The fringe benefits of Mrs. Helen Giza include a payment of 200 THOUS for the fiscal year and a payment of 400 THOUS for the year 2019, which Mrs. Helen Giza received in connection with her appointment to the Management Board. In the year 2021, Mrs. Helen Giza will receive a further payment of 200 THOUS in connection with her appointment to the Management Board. 5 Mr. Michael Brosnan resigned from the Management Board with effect as of the end of October 31, 2019. Therefore, the amounts of his non-performance-based compensation as set out herein relate to the period until October 31, 2019. On the basis of the Compensation System 2020+, the Man- agement Board members were granted so-called Performance Shares for the fiscal year under the MB LTIP 2020 as a Long- Term Incentive. The MB LTIP 2020 was approved in the fiscal year by the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG upon recommendation of the Human Resources Committee and follows on the MB LTIP 2019, under which, as of the end of 2019, no further Performance Shares may be granted. The Performance Shares granted to the members of the Man- agement Board under MB LTIP 2020 are non-equity, cash- settled virtual compensation instruments with a performance period of three years. Any proceeds from Performance Shares are subject to the achievement of three equally weighted per- formance targets and further depend on the development of the stock exchange price of the shares of the Company. The proceeds from the Performance Shares (after taxes and con- tributions) are paid over to a credit institution which uses them for the purchase of shares of the Company on the stock exchange. The shares acquired in this way are subject to a holding period of at least one year. The proceeds from the Long-Term Incentive are therefore not accessible to the Man- agement Board members prior to the lapse of a period of at least four years. The grant amount for the Performance Shares equals 135 % (multiplier of 1.35) of the relevant base salary of the respec- tive member of the Management Board. In order to determine the number of Performance Shares to be granted to the respective Management Board member, the respective grant amount is divided by the value per Performance Share deter- mined in accordance with IFRS 2 and considering the average share price of the shares of the Company over a period of 30 calendar days prior to each respective grant date. The number of Performance Shares to vest for each member of the Management Board depends on the achievement of the performance targets. The target achievement is measured based on the achievement of three equally weighted financial performance targets: Reve- nue growth (Revenue Growth), Net Income growth (Net Income Growth) and return on invested capital (ROIC), as provided in CHaRT 4.15. The Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG has defined specific target values for each performance tar- get that lead to a target achievement of 0 % (lower threshold), 100 % and 200 % (cap). The following applies for each performance target: If the lower target value is not exceeded, a target achievement of 0 % applies. If the upper target value is exceeded, a target achieve- ment of 200 % (cap) applies. If the actual financial figures are between the respective target values for a target achievement of 0 % and 100 % or 100 % and 200 %, the target achieve- C 4.15 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE ment is determined by linear interpolation. The achievement of each performance target is determined annually. The three performance targets are weighted equally to determine the yearly target achievement. At the end of the three-year perfor- mance period, the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG determines the overall target achievement by taking the average of the yearly target achievements of the applicable performance period. Based on the overall target achievement, the number of Perfor- mance Shares to vest is determined for each member of the Revenue Growth and Net Income Growth are determined at constant currency. In particular to ensure the comparability of the underlying financial figures of the performance targets with the Compa- nys operating performance and to adequately recognize the actual performance of the members of the Management Board for the components with long-term incentive effects, the Super- visory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG has decided to disregard the impairment in the Latin America Seg- ment that solely relates to the carrying amounts and is described in connection with the Short-Term Incentive above also when determining the relevant target achievement for the fiscal year under the LTIP 2016 (grant 2018), the MB LTIP 2019 (grant 2019) and the MB LTIP 2020 (grant 2020).

The fair value of the Performance Shares issued in Novem- ber of the fiscal year amounted on the grant date to 61.27 for commitments in euros (applicable to Mrs. Helen Giza, Dr. Katarzyna Mazur-Hofsa, Dr. Olaf Schermeier and Mr. Harry de Wit) and to $72.17 (61.94) for commitments in U.S. dollars (applicable to Messrs. Rice Powell, Franklin W. Maddux, MD, William Valle and Kent Wanzek). In the previous year, 114,999 Performance Shares with a total value of 7,158 THOUS were granted under the MB LTIP 2019. The fair value of the Performance Shares issued in July 2019 amounted on the grant date to 62.10 for commitments in euro (applicable to Dr. Katarzyna Mazur-Hofsa, Dr. Olaf Schermeier and Mr. Harry de Wit) and to $69.71 (62.69) for commitments in U.S. dollars (applicable to Messrs.

Maddux, MD with effect as of January 1, 2020 and, therefore, they have received compensation payments to be set out herein in each case commencing only as of such respective dates. 3 The amounts indicated for stock options do not include the expenses from stock options which have been granted to the member of the Management Board William Valle prior to his appointment to the Management Board. 4 Mr. Michael Brosnan resigned from the Management Board with effect as of the end of October 31, 2019. The expenses for long-term incentive components result from the compensation compo- nents granted to Mr. Michael Brosnan under the LTIP 2011, the LTIP 2016, the MB LTIP 2019 and the Share Based Award which are payable or can be exercised, as the case may be, on the relevant regular vesting date in accordance with the respective plan conditions. Performance Shares under the LTIP 2016 Until the end of year 2018, grants of Performance Shares under the LTIP 2016 constituted a component of the compensation of the members of the Management Board. As of the end of year 2018 grants under the LTIP 2016 are no longer possible. How- ever, individual members of the Management Board may exer- cise Performance Shares which have previously been granted and, taking into consideration vesting periods, the achievement of defined performance targets as well as, subject to deviating stipulations in the individual case, the continuation of the service relationship, receive (for the first time in the fiscal year) a share-based compensation with cash settlement from Perfor- mance Shares under the LTIP 2016. At December 31 of the fiscal year, the members of the Management Board then in office held a total of 135,473 Performance Shares (2019: 211,878) under the LTIP 2016. Stock options and Phantom Stock under the LTIP 2011 Until the end of the year 2015, grants under the LTIP 2011, which consisted of the Phantom Stock Plan 2011 and the Stock Option Plan 2011, constituted a component of the compensa- tion for the members of the Management Board. As of the end of the fiscal year 2015, grants under the LTIP 2011 are no longer possible. However, individual members of the Management Board may exercise Phantom Stock or stock options which have previously been granted, taking into consideration black- out periods, the achievement of defined performance targets as well as, subject to deviating stipulations in the individual case, the continuation of the service relationship. At December 31 of the fiscal year the members of the Manage- ment Board then in office did not hold any Phantom Stock (2019: 23,336) pursuant to the Phantom Stock Plan 2011 and a total of 465,308 stock options (2019: 452,989) originating from the Stock Option Plan 2011. For details regarding the con- ditional capital used to secure the Stock Option Plan 2011, please see the section Conditional Capital of the notes to the annual financial statements and consolidated financial state- ments of the Company. The development and status of stock options in the fiscal year of the members of the Management Board serving at Decem- ber 31 of the fiscal year are shown in more detail in TaBLe 4.20.

Franklin W. Maddux, MD and William Valle have been granted before the respective appointment to the Management Board. III. Total Compensation The structure for the total compensation of the Management Board for the fiscal year is shown in CHaRT 4.21. The Compensation System 2020+ provides for an overall maximum compensation amount for each Management Board C 4.21 CAPS AND MAXIMUM COMPENSATION member. These maximum compensation amounts limit the payouts and allocations of the total compensation granted to a Management Board member for a fiscal year, irrespective of the dates of the payouts and allocations. The maximum com- pensation amount for each Management Board member can be below the sum of the potentially achievable payouts and allocations from the individual compensation components granted for a fiscal year. The maximum compensation amounts are defined based on the currency of the base salary as stated in the respective Management Board members service agreement and amount to 12,000 THOUS or $13,434 THOUS for the Chairman of the Management Board (CEO), 9,500 THOUS or $10,635 THOUS for the CEO North America and 7,000 THOUS or $7,836 THOUS for all other current Management Board functions. The amount of the total compensation of the Management Board for the fiscal year and for the previous year is shown in TaBLe 4.22 ON page 136. Personal investment from the variable compensation for the fiscal year In order to let the members of the Management Board partici- pate adequately in the sustainable corporate development, the Supervisory Board decided that the members of the Manage- ment Board - by mutual agreement - acquire shares in FMC AG & Co. KGaA for a portion of their Short-Term Incentive. The shares acquired in this way may only be sold by the respective member of the Management Board after a period of three years from the date of acquisition has expired. The respective portion of the Short-Term Incentive for which a member of the Management Board acquires shares in FMC AG & Co. KGaA depends on the respective overall target achievement. Minimum at 0 % target achievement for variable components 1 STI = Short-Term Incentive 2 LTI = Long-Term Incentive Target Compensation at 100 % target achievement Maximum at maximum target achievement level and achievable payout opportunity for variable compensation components The net amounts to be invested by the members of the Man- agement Board are shown in TaBLe 4.23 ON page 136. As a consequence of this personal investment, between 36 % and 60 % of the Short-Term Incentive for the fiscal year of the respective member of the Management Board will be invested in shares of the Company, which can be sold or exercised, T 4.22 TOTAL COMPENSATION IN  THOUS Cash compensation (without long-term incentive components) Components with long-term incentive effect Total compensation (including long-term incentive components) T 4.23 PERSONAL INVESTMENT FROM THE NET SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR IN THOUS 2020 2019 1 2020 2019 1 2020 2019 1 Members of the Management Board serving as of December 31, 2020 Rice Powell 3,932 3,566 2,170 2,232 6,102 5,798 Helen Giza 2 2,014 707 1,070 865 3,084 1,572 Franklin W.

Rice Powell, Franklin W. Maddux, MD, William Valle, Kent Wanzek and Michael Brosnan). In principle, the translation of U.S. dollar amounts was done at the average exchange rate for the applicable calendar year; the translation of U.S. dollar amounts for Performance Shares granted under the MB LTIP 2020 (for the fiscal year) and under the MB LTIP 2019 (for the year 2019) was done at the closing rate of the applicable grant date. 2 Please note for purposes of comparison of the amounts indicated for the fiscal year that Mrs. Helen Giza was appointed as member of the Management Board only with effect as of November 1, 2019 and Mr. Franklin W. Maddux, MD with effect as of January 1, 2020 and, therefore, they have received compensation payments to be set out herein in each case commencing only as of such respective dates. 3 Mr. Michael Brosnan resigned from the Management Board with effect as of the end of October 31, 2019. respectively, at the earliest after a period of three years. This calculation is based on the simplified assumption of a personal tax and duty burden of 50 % on the payout of the Short-Term Incentive. The Supervisory Board further decided that the members of the Management Board - by mutual agreement - acquire shares in FMC AG & Co. KGaA for a portion of their components with long-term incentive effects granted to them as Management Board members. The shares acquired in this way may only be sold by the respective member of the Management Board after a period of three years from the date of acquisition has expired. The respective portion of the components with long-term incentive effects for which a member of the Management Board acquires shares in FMC AG & Co. KGaA depends on the respective overall target achievement under the LTIP 2016 (grant 2018) and under the MB LTIP 2019 (grant 2019). Accordingly, the concrete amounts to be invested from the payouts from the aforementioned long-term incentive grants can be determined in 2022 (for the grant 2018 under the LTIP 2016) and in 2023 (for the grant 2019 under the MB LTIP 2019) only. The acquisition of the shares in FMC AG & Co. KGaA by the members of the Management Board shall be made after the amounts to be invested have been determined. The invest- ment of the proceeds from the MB LTIP 2020 in shares of the Company as provided for under the MB LTIP 2020 remains unaffected. IV. Commitments to members of the Management Board in the event of a termination of their appointment The following pension commitments and other benefits are also components of the compensation for the members of the Management Board: Individual contractual pension commit- ments for the members of the Management Board Messrs. Rice Powell, Dr. Olaf Schermeier, William Valle, Kent Wanzek and Harry de Wit have been granted by Fresenius Medical Care Management AG. Each of the individual contractual pension commitments by Fresenius Medical Care Management AG provides for a pension and survivor benefit (Hinterbliebenenversorgung) as of the time of conclusively ending active work (at age 65 at the earli- est) or upon occurrence of disability or incapacity to work (Berufs- oder Erwerbsunfahigkeit) or of reduction of earning capacity (Erwerbsminderung), calculated by reference to the amount of the recipients most recent base salary. Members of the Management Board who have been members of the Man- agement Board for at least ten years at the time of their final retirement from active employment have this entitlement already upon reaching the age of 63 (early retirement); in this case, the benefits are reduced by 0.5 % per calendar month that the member leaves active employment before reaching the age of 65. The retirement pension will be based on 30 % of the most recent base salary (for the Management Board members Rice Powell, Dr. Olaf Schermeier and Kent Wanzek) or the 5-year average of the last base salaries (for the Management Board members William Valle and Harry de Wit) and will increase for each complete year of service by 1.5 percentage points up to a maximum of 45 %. Current pensions increase according to legal requirements (Sec. 16 of the German Act to improve com- pany pension plans, BetrAVG). 30 % of the gross amount of any post-retirement income from an activity of the Manage- ment Board member is in principle offset against the pension. If a Management Board member dies, the surviving spouse receives a pension amounting to 60 % of the pension claim resulting at that time. Furthermore, the deceased Management Board members own legitimate children (leibliche eheliche Kinder) receive an orphans pension amounting to 20 % of the pension claim resulting at that time, until the completion of their education or they reach 25 years of age, at the latest. All orphans pensions and the surviving spouses pension together, however, reach a maximum of 90 % of the Management Board members pension. If a Management Board member leaves the Management Board before reaching the age of 65, the rights to the aforementioned benefits remain, however the pension to be paid is reduced - unless the Management Board member is leaving because of the occurrence of an event insured against (occupational disability, incapacity to work, pension payments to surviving dependents in case of death or, if applicable, early retirement) - in proportion to the ratio of the actual years of service as a Management Board member to the potential years of service until reaching the age of 65. Based on individual contractual commitments, the Manage- ment Board members Messrs. Rice Powell, Franklin W. Maddux, MD, William Valle and Kent Wanzek additionally participated in the U.S.-based 401(k) savings plan in the fiscal year; in this regard, contributions in the amount of $8,550 (7,486) (2019: $8,400 (7,504)) were earned in the fiscal year in each case and allocated in January 2021 to the members of the Manage- ment Board mentioned above. This plan generally allows employees in the U.S. to invest a limited portion of their gross salaries in retirement pension programs. The Company sup- ports its employees at this with contributions of up to 50 % of the yearly made payments. Furthermore, the Management Board member Mr. Rice Powell has acquired non-forfeitable benefits from participation in employee pension plans of Fresenius Medical Care North Amer- ica, which provide payment of pensions as of the age of 65 and the payment of reduced benefits as of the age of 55. In March 2002, the rights to receive benefits from the pension plans were frozen at the level then applicable. Additions to pension provisions in the fiscal year for the mem- bers of the Management Board in office on December 31 of the fiscal year amounted to 4,082 THOUS (2019: 6,751 THOUS). The pension commitments are shown in TaBLe 4.24 ON page 138. A post-employment non-competition covenant was agreed by all members of the Management Board. If such covenant becomes applicable, the members of the Management Board for a period of up to two years shall receive compensation amounting to half of their respective annual base salaries for each year of application of the non-competition covenant. The service agreements of the members of the Management Board contain no express provisions that are triggered by a change of control. The service agreements concluded with the members of the Management Board provide for a severance payment cap. Under this cap, payments in connection with the early termina- tion of a Management Board activity may not exceed the value of two years compensation and may not compensate more than the remaining term of the service agreement. For the cal- culation of the relevant annual compensation, only the non- performance-based compensation components are applied. If Fresenius Medical Care Management AG terminates the service agreement for good cause or would be entitled to do so, no severance payments are made. T 4.24 DEVELOPMENT AND STATUS OF PENSION COMMITMENTS 1 IN  THOUS 1 The status of the amount of the pension commitment according to HGB as of December 31, 2020 is 24,158 THOUS (2019: 19,741 THOUS). Of this amount, 12,791 THOUS (2019: 13,507 THOUS) are attributable to Mr. Rice Powell, 1,530 THOUS (2019: 1,058 THOUS) to Dr. Olaf Schermeier, 3,498 THOUS (2019: 0 THOUS) to Mr. William Valle, 4,452 THOUS (2019: 3,849 THOUS) to Mr. Kent Wanzek and 1,887 THOUS (2019: 1,327 THOUS) to Mr. Harry de Wit. For the fiscal year and for 2019, no pension commitments are attributable to Mrs. Helen Giza, Mr. Franklin W. Maddux, MD and Dr. Katarzyna Mazur-Hofsa. 2 The pension commitment of Messrs. Rice Powell, Willam Valle and Kent Wanzek is denominated in U.S. dollar. For the calculation of the pension provisions an exchange rate of 0.84 / $1 was applied. Brosnan receives an annual compensation for the agreed post-employment non-competition covenant in the amount of $553 THOUS (451 THOUS) p.a. for a period of two years. It was agreed with Mr. Michael Brosnan that he is entitled to receive a retirement pension on the basis of the individual contractual pension commitment of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG in the annual amount of $405 THOUS (330 THOUS) from January 1, 2021. The compensation for the agreed post-employment non-competition covenant is credited against the retirement pension. Mr. Dominik Wehner was a member of the Management Board until the end of December 31, 2017. In his termination agree- ment, it was agreed with respect to the compensation compo- nents provided in his service agreement for the period from January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2022 that he will annually receive a base salary of 425 THOUS and an amount of 30 % of his base salary. In addition, Mr. Dominik Wehner is entitled to fringe benefits such as the private use of his company car, reimburse- V. Miscellaneous All members of the Management Board have received individ- ual contractual commitments for the continuation of their com- pensation in cases of sickness for a maximum of twelve months; after six months of sick leave, insurance benefits may be set off against such payments. If a Management Board member dies, the surviving dependents will be paid three more monthly installments after the month of death, not to exceed, however, the amount due between the time of death and the scheduled expiration of the respective service agreement. Mr. Michael Brosnan was a member of the Management Board until the end of October 31, 2019. In his termination agreement, it was agreed with respect to the compensation components provided in his service agreement for the period from Novem- ber 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020 that he will receive a base sal- ary of $850 THOUS (744 THOUS) p.a. (pro rata for the period from November 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019). In the fiscal year, Mr. Michael Brosnan received fringe benefits in the form of reimbursement of fees for the preparation of tax returns and for financial planning, insurance benefits, contributions to pen- sion, accident, life and health insurances and housing, rent and relocation supplements as well as tax burden compensation due to varying tax rates in Germany and the U.S. (net compen- sation) and a car allowance in the total amount of $257 THOUS (225 THOUS) (2019: $17 THOUS (15 THOUS) for the period from November 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019). Additionally, Mr. Michael Brosnan participated in the U.S.-based 401(k) savings plan until December 31, 2020. For the period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, Mr. Michael Brosnan also received an amount equivalent to 30 % of his base salary. The compen- sation components granted to Mr. Michael Brosnan under the LTIP 2016, the MB LTIP 2019 and in the form of Share Based Awards are payable or exercisable in accordance with the respective plan conditions. As of January 1, 2021, Mr. Michael ment of fees for the preparation of tax returns and for financial planning, insurance benefits and contributions to pension and health insurance in a total amount of approximately 35 THOUS p.a. The compensation components granted to Mr. Dominik Wehner under the LTIP 2011, the LTIP 2016 and in form of Share Based Awards are payable or can be exercised, as the case may be, upon the relevant regular vesting date in accordance with the respective plan conditions. As of the completion of the age of 65, Mr. Dominik Wehner will receive a company-funded retirement pension in accordance with the individual contrac- tual pension commitment by Fresenius Medical Care Manage- ment AG, as described before. Mr. Ronald Kuerbitz, who was a member of the Management Board until February 17, 2017, received an annual non-compete compensation from February 17, 2017 for a period of two years; this compensation amounted in the fiscal year to 0 THOUS (2019: 90 THOUS). It was also agreed with him that, after the end of his service agreement, he would act as an advisor to National Medical Care, Inc. from August 14, 2017 until the end of August 13, 2019. The consideration granted for such services (including reimbursement of expenses) amounts to 0 THOUS (2019: 167 THOUS) for the fiscal year. As of the completion of the age of 65, Mr. Ronald Kuerbitz will receive a company-funded retirement pension of $146 THOUS (119 THOUS) per year. Mr. Roberto Fuste, who was a member of the Management Board until March 31, 2016, received pension payments in the amount of approximately 274 THOUS (2019: 274 THOUS) in the fiscal year. Prof. Emanuele Gatti, who was a member of the Management Board until March 31, 2014, received pension payments in the amount of 355 THOUS in the fiscal year (2019: 355 THOUS). Instead of a pension provision, a consulting agreement was entered into with Dr. Ben Lipps, who was the Chairman of the Management Board until December 31, 2012, for the period from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2021. Under this consult- ing agreement, Dr. Ben Lipps provides consulting services on certain fields and within a specified time frame and is subject to a non-compete covenant. The consideration to be granted by Fresenius Medical Care Management AG for such services (including reimbursement of expenses) amounted for 2019 to 568 THOUS. An amendment to the agreement was made in 2019 which provides for a one-off payment of 1,129 THOUS for the remaining term of the agreement. This payment, too, was made in 2019. All payments for services to be performed by him under the consulting agreement have thus been made. In accordance with applicable legal provisions, no loans or advance payments for future compensation components were made to the members of the Management Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG in the fiscal year. The payments to U.S. members of the Management Board Rice Powell, Helen Giza, Franklin W. Maddux, MD, William Valle and Kent Wanzek were paid in part in the U.S. (in U.S. dollar) and in part in Germany (in euro). For the part paid in Germany, it was agreed with the members of the Management Board Rice Pow- ell, Franklin W. Maddux, MD and Kent Wanzek that due to vary- ing tax rates in both countries, the increased or lower tax bur- den to such members of the Management Board arising from German tax rates in comparison to U.S. tax rates will be bal- anced or will be paid back by them (net compensation). Pursu- ant to a modified net compensation agreement, these mem- bers of the Management Board will be treated as if they were taxed in their home country, the United States, only. Therefore, the gross amounts may be retroactively changed. Since the actual tax burden can only be calculated in connection with the preparation of the Management Board members tax returns, subsequent adjustments may have to be made, which will then be retroactively covered in future compensation reports. To the extent permitted by law, Fresenius Medical Care Manage- ment AG undertook to indemnify the members of the Manage- ment Board from claims against them arising out of their work for the Company and its affiliates, to the extent such claims exceed their liability under German law. To secure such obliga- tions, a Directors & Officers liability insurance exists with a deductible that corresponds to the specifications according to the German Stock Corporation Act. Former members of the Management Board did not receive any compensation in the fiscal year other than mentioned herein, whereupon the total compensation amounted to 629 THOUS (2019: 2,984 THOUS). As of December 31 of the fiscal year, pension obligations, in accordance with IAS 19, towards this group of persons exist in an amount of 36,587 THOUS (2019: 37,373 THOUS). According to HGB, the status of the pension commitments towards this group of persons as of December 31 of the fiscal year amounted to 32,056 THOUS (2019: 31,156 THOUS). VI. Tables of the value of benefits granted and received The German Corporate Governance Code in the previous ver- sion dated February 7, 2017 provided that the compensation report shall include information for each member of the Man- agement Board on the benefits granted and received as well as on pension expenses for the fiscal year. The model tables pro- vided in the appendix to the German Corporate Governance Code in the referenced version were recommended to be used to present this information. TaBLeS 4.25 aND 4.26 STaRTINg ON page 140 include informa- tion on the value of benefits granted and received. They corre- spond, to a large extent, to the structure and form of the model tables of the German Corporate Governance Code in its previ- ous version dated February 7, 2017, to allow for the comparabil- ity with the previous years figures. Compensation of the Supervisory Board The compensation of the FMC AG & Co. KGaA Supervisory Board is set out in section 13 of the Articles of Association. The Annual General Meeting 2020 of FMC AG & Co. KGaA on August 27, 2020 resolved to amend section 13 of the Articles of Association and the compensation of the Supervisory Board with effect from January 1, 2021. In particular, the variable performance-based compensation component presented below will be abolished.

Rice Powell, Franklin W. Maddux, MD, William Valle and Kent Wanzek). The plan terms of the Share Based Award and of the LTIP 2011 entitle to allocations in euro. In principle, the translation of U.S. dollar amounts was done at the average exchange rates for the applicable calendar year; the translation of U.S. dollar amounts for the LTIP 2016 was done at the closing rate of the applicable vesting date. 3 The amounts for the Stock Option Plan 2011 as set out herein correspond to the intrinsic value of the stock options at the time of exercise. For the fiscal year, the members of the Supervisory Board were compensated on the basis of and in accordance with section 13 of the Articles of Association in the version applicable in the fiscal year as follows: Each Supervisory Board member received a base salary of $88 THOUS (2019: $88 THOUS) for the full fiscal year, payable in four equal installments at the end of a calendar quarter. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board received additional com- pensation of $88 THOUS (2019: $88 THOUS) and the Vice Chairman received additional compensation of $44 THOUS (2019: $44 THOUS) in each case for the full fiscal year. In addition, each member of the Supervisory Board received, as a variable performance-based compensation component (here- inafter also: performance-based compensation), additional remuneration which was based on the respective average growth of earnings per share of the Company (EPS) during the period of the last three fiscal years prior to the payment date (3-year Average EPS Growth). The amount of the perfor- mance-based compensation was $60 THOUS in case of achiev- ing a 3-year Average EPS Growth corridor from 8.00 % to 8.99 %, $70 THOUS in the corridor from 9.00 % to 9.99 % and $80 THOUS in case of a 3-year Average EPS Growth of 10.00 % or more. If the aforementioned targets were reached, the respective variable remuneration amounts of the perfor- mance-based compensation were earned to their full extent, i.e., within these margins there was no pro rata remuneration. In any case, this component was capped at the maximum amount of $80 THOUS per annum. Reciprocally, the members of the Supervisory Board were only entitled to the remunera- tion component if the 3-year Average EPS Growth of at least 8.00 % was reached. Provided that the relevant targets had been achieved, the remuneration was, in principle, disbursed on a yearly basis following approval of the Companys annual financial statements at the end of the calendar quarter in which the Companys annual financial statements were approved. For the fiscal year, the 3-year Average EPS Growth for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 was relevant. In application of the principles above, for the fiscal year no enti- tlement to a payment of performance-based compensation was achieved (2019: $0 THOUS). As a member of a committee, a Supervisory Board member of FMC AG & Co. KGaA additionally annually received $44 THOUS (2019: $44 THOUS). A member of a committee who served as chairman or vice chairman of a committee additionally received $22 THOUS and $11 THOUS a year, respectively (2019: $22 THOUS and $11 THOUS, respectively), payable in identical installments at the end of a calendar quarter. For memberships in the Nomination Committee of the Supervisory Board and in the Joint Committee of the Company as well as in the capacity of their respective chairmen and vice chairmen, no separate remuneration was granted to the members of the Supervisory Board. In accordance with section 13e para. 3 of the Articles of Association of FMC AG & Co. KGaA, the members of the Joint Committee are, however, entitled to receive an attendance fee in the amount of $3.5 THOUS. Should a member of the FMC AG & Co. KGaA Supervisory Board at the same time be a member of the Supervisory Board of the General Partner Fresenius Medical Care Management AG and receive compensation for his / her work on the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG, the compen- sation for the work as a FMC AG & Co. KGaA Supervisory Board member shall be reduced by half. The same applies to the additional compensation for the Chairman of the FMC AG & Co. KGaA Supervisory Board and the Vice Chairman, to the extent that they are at the same time chairman and vice chairman, respectively, of the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG. To the extent the vice chairman of the FMC AG & Co. KGaA Supervisory Board is at the same time chairman of the Supervisory Board at Fresenius Medical Care Management AG, he shall receive no additional compensation for his work as vice chairman of the FMC AG & Co. KGaA Super- visory Board. The compensation of the members of the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Medical Care Management AG and the compensation of the members of its committees are charged to FMC AG & Co. KGaA in accordance with section 7 para. 3 of the Articles of Association of FMC AG & Co. KGaA. The members of the Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA are to be reimbursed for the expenses incurred in the exercise of their office, which also include the applicable VAT. For the benefit of the members of the Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA a Directors & Officers liability insurance exists with a deductible that corresponds to the specifications according to the AktG. The total compensation of the Supervisory Board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA, including the amount charged by Fresenius Medical Care Management AG to FMC AG & Co. KGaA, is stated in TaBLe 4.27 STaRTINg ON page 145.

KGaAs general partner and is wholly owned by Fresenius SE. Management Board refers to the members of the management board of Management AG and, except as otherwise specified, Supervisory Board refers to the supervisory board of FMC AG & Co. KGaA. The term North America Segment refers to the North America operating segment, the term EMEA Segment refers to the Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segment, the term Asia- Pacific Segment refers to the Asia-Pacific operating segment, and the term Latin America Segment refers to the Latin America operating segment. For further discussion of the Compa- nys operating segments, See NOTe 26. Basis of presentation The FMC AG & Co. KGaA as a stock exchange listed company in a member state of the European Union (EU) fulfills its obligation to prepare and publish the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as they are to be applied in the EU, as well as applying section 315e of the German Commercial Code (HGB), using the euro as the Companys reporting and functional currency. The consolidated financial statements of FMC AG & Co. KGaA at December 31, 2020 have been prepared and are published in accordance with the standards valid on the balance sheet date issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the mandatory Interpreta- tions of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), which are bind- ing to be applied in the EU. Furthermore, the Company prepares consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB which is filed on Form 20-F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At December 31, 2020, there were no IFRS or IFRIC interpretations as endorsed by the EU relevant for reporting that differed from IFRS as issued by the IASB. Moreover, the notes include information required by HGB according to Section 315e (1) HGB. In addition to the IFRS consolidated financial statements, a group management report must be pre- pared according to section 315 HGB. The Company is included in the IFRS consolidated financial statements of Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA, Bad Homburg v. d. Hohe, pursuant to Section 315e of the German Commercial Code (HGB), published in the Federal Gazette and drawn up for the smallest circle of companies. The consoli- dated financial statements for the largest circle of companies are drawn up by Fresenius Manage- ment SE, Bad Homburg v. d. Hohe, and also published in the Federal Gazette. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires manage- ment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabili- ties and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Such financial statements reflect all adjust- ments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in all future periods affected. In order to improve clarity of presentation, various items are aggregated in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income. These items are analyzed separately in the notes where this provides useful information to the users of the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated balance sheets contain all information required to be disclosed by IAS 1 (Pre- sentation of Financial Statements) and are in accordance with Accounting Interpretation 1 (AIC 1, Balance Sheet Classification according to current / non-current Distinction in compliance with IAS 1) classified on the basis of the liquidity of assets and liabilities following the consolidated balance sheets. The consolidated statements of income are classified using the cost-of-sales accounting format. The Company applies IAS 29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies, in its Argen- tine and Lebanese subsidiaries due to inflation in these countries. TaBLe 5.6 details the specific inputs used to calculate the loss on net monetary position on a country-specific basis. T 5.6 INPUTS FOR THE CALCULATION OF LOSSES ON NET MONETARY POSITIONS In the consolidated balance sheets, Non-current provisions and other non-current liabilities in the amount of 51,831 as of December 31, 2019 have been reclassified to line item current provi- sions and other current liabilities to correct for an immaterial error in the classification of certain put options assumed as part of the acquisition of nephrology clinics. Additionally, we have adjusted the prior years comparative consolidated financial statements within the following footnotes to correct for immaterial errors in classification: 1. Inventories (See NOTe 8)  An amount of 5,955 was reclassified from raw materials and purchased components to work in process for 2019. 2. Financial instruments (See NOTe 23)  Cash and cash equivalents of 72,340 categorized as assets measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) were recategorized as measured at amortized cost and removed from the leveling table. The remaining cash and cash equivalents of 166,677 categorized as Level 2 in 2019 were categorized as Level 1.  Gain / loss recognized in equity for put option liabilities of 13,701 in 2019 was updated to 14,523. This includes 154,436 of gains / losses recognized in profit and loss and (153,614) of dividends (the allocation of profit or loss and payments of dividends to noncontrolling interests) which had been disclosed separately prior to 2020.  Gain / loss recognized in equity for put option liabilities of (50,612) in 2018 was updated to (48,075). This includes 142,279 of gains / losses recognized in profit and loss and (139,742) of dividends (the allocation of profit or loss and payments of dividends to noncontrolling interests) which had been disclosed separately prior to 2020. In addition to the adjustments noted above, certain revenue line items in the prior years compar- ative consolidated financial statements pertaining to the Companys segment and Corporate activities have been adjusted to conform to the current years presentation (See NOTe 26). At February 26, 2021, the Management Board authorized the consolidated financial statements for issue and passed them through to the Supervisory Board for review and authorization. Significant accounting policies A) Principles of consolidation and composition of the group The financial statements of consolidated entities have been prepared using uniform accounting methods in accordance with IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements (IFRS 10). Acquisitions of companies are accounted for under the purchase method. Besides FMC AG & Co. KGaA, the consolidated financial statements include all material subsid- iaries according to IFRS 10 over which the Company has control. FMC AG & Co. KGaA controls an entity if it has power over the entity through existing rights that give the Company the current ability to direct the activities that significantly affect the Companys return. In addition, the Company is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from the involvement with the entity and the Company has the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the amount of the Companys return. The equity method is applied in accordance with IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (IAS 28). Generally, equity method investees are entities in which FMC AG & Co. KGaA, directly or indirectly, holds 50 % or less of the voting power and can exercise significant influ- ence over their financial and operating policies. While our investment in Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd. makes up a large portion of our equity method investees, there are no investments in equity method investees that are individually material to the Company. Acquisitions of companies are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations (IFRS 3) at the date of acquisition. Initially, all identifiable assets and liabilities of subsidiaries as well as the noncontrolling interests are recognized at their fair values. The cost is then compared with the fair value of the net assets acquired. Any remaining debit balance is recognized as good- will and is tested at least once a year for impairment. Any excess of the net fair value of identifi- able assets and liabilities over cost still existing after reassessing the purchase price allocation, subsequent to its finalization, is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Intercompany revenues, expenses, income, receivables, payables, accruals, provisions and com- mitments and contingencies, are eliminated. Profits and losses on items of property, plant and equipment and inventory acquired from other group entities are also eliminated. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on temporary differences resulting from consol- idation procedures. Noncontrolling interest (NCI) is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent and is recognized at its fair value at the date of first consolidation. Profits and losses attributable to the noncontrolling interests are separately disclosed in the consoli- dated statements of income. There are no non-controlling interests that are individually material to the Company. The Company writes put options on NCI mainly for dialysis clinics in which nephrologists or nephrology groups own an equity interest. While in certain of the dialysis clinics the Company is generally the majority owner, other non-affiliated parties, such as groups of nephrologists or a single nephrologist, hold an NCI position. Generally, the put options associated with this business model are valid for an unlimited time. Accordingly, they do not constrain a long-term investment into a dialysis clinic by the NCI holder. The put options provide for settlement in cash. For these put options, IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation (IAS 32) paragraph 23 requires the Com- pany to recognize a liability for the present value of the exercise price of the option. The put option liability is recorded in other current provisions and other current liabilities and other non-current provisions and other non-current liabilities at present value of the redemption amount at the balance sheet date. The exercise price of the option is generally based on fair value which is approximated by a multiple of earnings, e.g. a multiple of the proportionate earn- ings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of the dialysis clinic, and is therefore affected by the periodic changes in the profitability of such a clinic. The Company believes the accounting treatment of the changes to the put option liability under IFRS to this date has not been finally clarified. In the absence of IFRS guidance specifically applicable to the accounting for put options on NCI, the Company, in line with IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Account- ing Estimates and Errors (IAS 8) paragraph 10, applied the present access method. According to the present access method, NCI are further recorded in equity. The initial recognition of the put option liability, as well as valuation differences, is recorded in equity with no impact to the income statement (See NOTe 1 H). This presentation results in information that is relevant to the eco- nomic decision-making needs of users and to provide reliable financial information as the Com- pany considers these NCI with written put options as equity holders and accordingly attributes net income to NCI. T 5.7 PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES The consolidated financial statements for 2020 include FMC AG & Co. KGaA as well as 2,305 companies. In 2020, 49 companies were accounted for by the equity method. During 2020, 113 companies were first-time consolidations and 22 companies were deconsolidated. Name Country Main activity Ownership The principal subsidiaries of the Company are those with the most significant contribution to the Companys revenue, net income or net assets. The Companys interest in these subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are listed in TaBLe 5.7. The complete list of participations in affiliated and associated companies of FMC AG & Co. KGaA will be submitted to the electronic Federal Gazette and the electronic companies register as well as published on www.freseniusmedicalcare.com/en/investors/news-publications/financial- reports/ as part of the annual financial report of FMC AG & Co. KGaA according to German law. For 2020, the following fully consolidated German subsidiaries (See TaBLe 5.8 ON page 158) of the Company will apply the exemption provided in Section 264 (3) or Section 264b of the HGB and therefore will be exempt from applying certain legal requirements to prepare notes to the stat- utory standalone financial statements and a management report as well as the requirements of an independent audit and public disclosure. B) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash funds and all short-term investments (recorded at nominal value) with original maturities of up to three months. Short-term investments are highly liquid and readily convertible into known amounts of cash. The risk of changes in value is insignificant. C) Trade accounts and other receivables from unrelated parties Trade accounts and other receivables from unrelated parties are posted at fair value (nominal value less expected credit loss). For information regarding expected credit losses, See NOTe 2 C. D) Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined by using the average or first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value (See NOTe 8). Costs included in inventories are based on invoiced costs and / or production costs as applicable. Included in production costs are material, direct labor and production overhead, including depreciation charges.

Hohe, Germany VIVONIC GmbH Sailauf, Germany Zentrum fur Nieren- und Hochdruckkrankheiten Bensheim GmbH Bensheim, Germany E) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation (See NOTe 10). Maintenance and repair costs (day-to-day servicing) are expensed as incurred. The Company rec- ognizes in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing parts and major inspections if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost can be measured reliably. Depreciation on prop- erty, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 4 to 50 years for buildings and improvements with a weighted average life of 14 years and 3 to 19 years for machinery and equipment with a weighted average life of 11 years. Internal use platform software that is integral to the computer equipment it sup- ports is included in property, plant and equipment. In fiscal years until December 31, 2018, prior to the implementation of IFRS 16, property, plant and equipment under capital leases was stated at the present value of future minimum lease pay- ments at the inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation. Equipment held under capital leases and leasehold improvements was amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. F) Leases A lease is defined as a contract that conveys the right to use an underlying asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. According to IFRS 16, a contract is or contains a lease if:  the underlying asset is identified in the contract, and  the customer has both the right to direct the identified assets use and to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from that use. Under IFRS 16, the Company is required to recognize a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments for almost all leases. The Company applies both the short-term and low-value lease exemption. These leases are exempt from balance sheet recognition and lease payments will be recognized as expenses over the lease term. IFRS 16 is not applied to leases of intangible assets. Lease liabilities Lease liabilities are initially recognized at the present value of the following payments:  fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable,  variable lease payments (linked to an index or interest rate),  expected payments under residual value guarantees,  the exercise price of purchase options, where exercise is reasonably certain,  lease payments in optional renewal periods, where exercise of extension options is reasonably certain, and  penalty payments for the termination of a lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of the respective termination option. Lease payments are discounted using the implicit interest rate underlying the lease if this rate can be readily determined. Otherwise, the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee is used as the discount rate. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Furthermore, lease liabilities may be remeasured due to lease modifications or reassess- ments of the lease. A lease modification is any change in lease terms that was not part of the initial terms and conditions of the lease, including increases of the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets or extending the contractual lease term, decreases of the scope of the lease by removing the right to use one or more underlying assets or shorten- ing the contractual lease term or changes in the consideration. Reassessments are changes in estimates or changes triggered by a clause that was part of the initial lease contract, including changes in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, change in the Companys estimate of the amount expected to be payable under residual value guarantees or change in the Companys assessment of whether it will exercise purchase, extension or termina- tion options. A lease modification is accounted for as a separate lease if the modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets and the consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope. Where a lease modification is accounted for as a separate lease, the respective new lease is recognized at the effective date of the modification based on the illustrated recognition and valuation principles with the initial lease remaining unchanged. Where a lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, the initial lease is remeasured. For most reassessments and lease modifications that are not accounted for as a separate lease, lease liabilities are remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments at a revised discount rate. For specific reassessments, the historical interest rate is used. The revised discount rate is determined at the effective date of the lease modification or the reassessment. When lease liabilities are remeasured in this way, a corresponding remeasurement is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset. Where a lease modification results in a decrease of the scope of the lease, any gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss to reflect the respective partial or full termination of the lease. For lease contracts that include both lease and non-lease components that are not separable from lease components, no allocation is performed. Each lease component and any associated non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease. Right-of-use assets The Company recognizes right-of-use asset at the commencement date of the respective lease. Right-of-use asset are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Upon initial recognition, cost comprises of:  the initial lease liability amount,  initial direct costs incurred when entering into the lease,  (lease) payments before commencement date of the respective lease, and  an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset,  less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset using the straight-line method. Where a lease agreement includes a transfer of ownership at the end of the lease term or the exercise of a purchase option is deemed reasonably certain, right-of-use assets are depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset using the straight-line method. In addition, right-of-use assets are reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements. For reassessments and lease modifications that are not accounted for as separate leases, a remeasurement corresponding to the respective remeasurement of the lease liability is recog- nized (for lease modifications and reassessments, as well as for partial or full termination of a lease please see guidance on Lease liabilities above). If the carrying amount of a right-of-use asset is reduced to zero by such remeasurements, the excess amount is recorded in profit or loss. Right-of-use assets are classified into right-of-use assets relating to land, buildings and improve- ments or machinery and equipment. In addition, prepayments on right-of-use assets are pre- sented separately (See NOTe 21). G) Intangible assets and goodwill Intangible assets such as non-compete agreements, technology, distribution rights, patents, licenses to treat, licenses to manufacture, distribute and sell pharmaceutical drugs, exclusive contracts and exclusive licenses, trade names, management contracts, application software, acute care agreements and customer relationships are recognized and reported apart from goodwill (See NOTe 11). Patient relationships, however, are not reported as separate intangible assets due to the missing contractual basis but are part of goodwill. Goodwill and identifiable intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually or when an event becomes known that could trigger an impairment. The Company identified certain trade names and qualified management contracts as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives because there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which those assets are expected to generate net cash inflows for the Company. IIntangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective useful lives to their residual values. The Company amortizes non-compete agreements over their useful lives which, on average, are eight years. Technology is amortized over its average useful lives of twelve years. Internally developed intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over their average useful lives of eight years. Licenses to manufacture, distribute and sell pharmaceutical drugs, exclusive contracts and exclusive licenses are amortized over their useful lives which on average is 13 years. Customer relationships are amortized over their average useful lives of 16 years. All other intan- gible assets are amortized over their weighted average useful lives of eight years. The weighted average useful life of all amortizable intangible assets is ten years. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment when events have occurred that may give rise to an impairment (See NOTe 1 O). To perform the annual impairment test of goodwill, the Company identified its groups of cash generating units (CGUs) and determined their carrying value by assigning the operating assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those groups of CGUs. Groups of CGUs reflect the lowest level on which goodwill is monitored for internal manage- ment purposes. One group of CGUs was identified in each of the Companys operating segments. For the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, all corporate assets and liabilities are allocated to the groups of CGUs. At least once a year, the Company compares the recoverable amount of each group of CGUs to the group of CGUs carrying amount. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of the value in use or the fair value less cost of disposal of a group of CGUs. In a first step, the value in use of the group of CGUs is determined using a discounted cash flow approach based upon the cash flow expected to be generated by the group of CGUs. In case that the value in use of the group of CGUs is less than its carrying amount and the fair value less cost of disposal is not esti- mated to be higher than the value in use, the difference is recorded as an impairment of the car- rying amount of the goodwill. To evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, the Company com- pares the fair values of intangible assets with their carrying values. An intangible assets fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow approach or other methods, if appropriate. For further information See NOTe 2 a. H) Financial instruments The Company classifies its financial instruments in accordance with IFRS 9 in the following measurement categories: at amortized cost, at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) and at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Financial assets are classified depending on the business model in which the financial assets are held and the contractual terms of the cash flows. Financial assets are only reclassified when the business model for managing those assets changes. During the reporting period, no financial instruments were reclassified. Purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for on the trading day. The Company does not make use of the fair value option, which allows financial instruments to be classified at FVPL upon initial recognition. At initial recognition financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value. Subsequent measurement is either at cost, FVPL or FVOCI. In general, financial liabilities are classified and subsequently measured at amortized cost, with the exception of contingent considerations resulting from a business combination, put option liabilities as well as derivative financial liabilities. Investments in equity instruments are recognized and subsequently measured at fair value. The Companys equity investments are not held for trading. In general, changes in the fair value of equity investments are recognized in the income statement. However, at initial recognition the Company elected, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, to represent subsequent changes in the fair value of individual strategic equity investments in other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI). The Company invested in several debt securities, with the objective to achieve both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets. All debt securities are consequently mea- sured at fair value. Some of these securities give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principle and interest. These securities are subsequently measured at FVOCI. Other securities are measured at FVPL. The Company, as option writer of existing put options, can be obligated to purchase the noncon- trolling interests held by third parties. The obligations are in the form of put liabilities and are exercisable at the third-party owners discretion within specified periods or upon the occurrence of certain events as outlined in each specific put option. If these put option liabilities were exer- cised, the Company would be required to purchase all or part of third-party owners noncon- trolling interests at the appraised fair value at the time of exercise. The initial recognition and subsequent measurement are recognized in equity of the Company. For further information related to the estimation of these fair values, See NOTe 23. Certain put option arrangements contain contingent triggers based on changes in legislation, which the Company has concluded are not genuine using the guidance in IFRS 9 B4.1.18 and IAS 32.25. The Company considers this subset of contracts as being non-genuine as the trigger in these clauses is considered to be an event that is extremely rare, highly abnormal and very unlikely to occur. Therefore, the Company has not recorded a liability on the balance sheet relat- ing to this subset of puts option contracts. Derivative financial instruments which primarily include foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps are recognized as assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet (See NOTe 23). From time to time, the Company may enter into other types of derivative instruments which are dealt with on a transaction by transaction basis. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are recognized in accumulated OCI (AOCI) in shareholders equity. The Company only designated the change in fair value of the spot element of foreign exchange forward con- tracts as the hedging instrument in cash flow hedging relationships and uses a hedge ratio for designated risks of 1:1. The forward elements are separately accounted for as cost of hedging in a separate component within AOCI. The ineffective portion of cash flow hedge is recognized in the income statement. The amounts recorded in AOCI are subsequently reclassified into earnings as a component of revenue for those foreign exchange contracts that hedge forecasted sales or as an adjustment of cost of revenue for those contracts that hedge forecasted intercompany product purchases. In connection with intercompany loans in foreign currency, the Company uses foreign exchange swaps to assure that no foreign exchange risks arise from those loans, which, if they qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, are also reported in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to selling, general and administrative expenses. The amounts recorded in AOCI are reclassified in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts recorded in AOCI for cash flow hedges related to product purchases from third parties are removed from AOCI and included directly in the carrying amount of the asset at initial recognition. Product purchases and sales designated in a cash flow hedging relationship are expected to affect profit and loss in the same period in which the cash flows occur. The critical terms of the forward exchange contracts gener- ally align with the hedged item. The economic relationship between forward exchange contracts and the hedged forecast transaction is based on the timing, currency and amount of the hedged cash flows. Ineffectiveness could arise in case the timing of the hedged transaction or the credit default risk changes. The Company enters into derivatives, particularly interest rate swaps and to a certain extent, interest rate options, to protect against the risk of rising interest rates. These interest rate deriv- atives are designated as cash flow hedges and have been entered into in order to effectively con- vert payments based on variable interest rates into payments at a fixed interest rate. The Com- pany determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the reference interest rates, maturities and the notional amounts. The effective portion of gains and losses of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is deferred in AOCI; the amount of gains and losses reclassified from AOCI are recorded in interest income and interest expenses. The change in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting is recorded in the income statement and usually offsets the change in value recorded in the income statement for the underlying asset or liability. Derivatives embedded in host contracts are accounted for as separate derivatives if their eco- nomic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contracts. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. I) Impairment of financial assets The impairment of financial assets is based on the expected credit loss approach, as introduced by IFRS 9. The expected credit loss approach requires that all impacted financial assets will carry a loss allowance based on their expected credit losses. Expected credit losses are a probability- weighted estimate of credit losses over the contractual life of the financial assets. This model comprises a three-stage approach. Upon recognition, the Company shall recognize losses that are expected within the next 12 months. If credit risk deteriorates significantly, from that time, impairment losses shall amount to lifetime expected losses. When assessing for signif- icant increases in credit risk, the Company shall compare the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the date of initial recognition. The Company should consider reasonable and sup- portable information including historic loss rates, present developments such as liquidity issues and information about future economic conditions, to ensure foreseeable changes in the customer-specific or macroeconomic environment are considered. Separately, there is the rebut- table presumption that the credit risk has increased significantly since the initial recognition when contractual payments are overdue by more than 30 days. In case of objective evidence of impairment there is an assignment to stage 3. The assignment of a financial asset to stage 3 should rely on qualitative knowledge on the customers unfavorable financial position (for example bankruptcy, lawsuits with private or public payers), or quantitative criteria, based on an individual maturity analysis. Independently, there is an assignment to stage 3 if the contractual payments are overdue by more than 360 days. When a counterpart defaults, all financial assets against this counterpart are considered impaired. The definition of default is mainly based on payment practices specific to individual regions and businesses. The Company recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets mea- sured at amortized cost, contract assets and lease receivables as well as in investments in debt securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. The financial assets mainly comprise of accounts receivable as well as cash and cash equivalents. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since ini- tial recognition of the respective instrument. Financial assets whose expected credit loss is not assessed individually are grouped on the basis of geographical regions and the impairment is generally assessed on the basis of macroeconomic indicators such as credit default swaps. For accounts receivable, the Company uses the simplified method which requires recognizing lifetime expected credit losses at inception. However, expected credit losses on cash and cash equivalents are measured according to the general method which is based on 12-month expected credit losses. Based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties the Company considers that its cash and cash equivalents have a low credit risk (as the counterparties are generally invest- ment grade). J) Foreign currency translation For purposes of these consolidated financial statements, the euro is the reporting currency. The requirement to report in euro arises from Section 315e and Section 244 HGB. Substantially all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that use a functional currency other than the euro are translated at year-end exchange rates, while revenues and expenses are translated at aver- age exchange rates. Adjustments for foreign currency translation fluctuations are excluded from net earnings and are reported in AOCI. In addition, the translation adjustments of certain inter- company borrowings, which are of a long-term nature, are reported in AOCI. Transactions in for- eign currencies recorded by subsidiaries are accounted for at the prevailing spot rate on the date of the respective transaction. Financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency are reval- ued at the spot rate as of the date of the consolidated statement of financial position. The exchange rates of the United States (U.S.) dollar affecting foreign currency translation devel- oped as shown in TaBLe 5.9.

Health care services Health care services revenue, other than the hospitalist and insurance revenues discussed below, are recognized on the date the patient receives treatment and includes amounts related to cer- tain services, products and supplies utilized in providing such treatment at an amount to which the company expects to be entitled. The patient is obligated to pay for health care services at amounts estimated to be receivable based upon the Companys standard rates or at rates deter- mined under reimbursement arrangements. In the U.S., these arrangements are generally with third party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid or commercial insurers. Outside the U.S., the reim- bursement is usually made through national or local government programs with reimbursement rates established by statute or regulation. For services performed for patients where the collection of the billed amount or a portion of the billed amount cannot be determined at the time services are performed, the Company concludes that the consideration is variable (implicit price concession) and records the difference between the billed amount and the amount estimated to be collectible as a reduction to health care services revenue. Implicit price concessions include such items as amounts due from patients without adequate insurance coverage, patient co-payment and deductible amounts due from patients with health care coverage. The Company determines implicit price concessions based primarily upon past collection history. Upon receipt of new information relevant for the determi- nation of the implicit price concession, the Company constrains, or adjusts the constraints for the variable consideration of the transaction price. Prior to the divestiture of the Companys controlling interest in Sound Inpatient Physicians, Inc. (Sound) on June 28, 2018, hospitalist revenues in the U.S. were reported at the estimated amount expected to be received from third-party payors, client hospitals, and others at the time services were provided. Third-party payors included federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care health plans, and commercial insurance companies. Inpatient acute care services rendered to Medicare and Medicaid program beneficiaries were paid accord- ing to a fee-for-service schedule. These rates varied according to a patient classification system that was based on clinical, diagnostic and other factors. Inpatient acute services generated through payment arrangements with managed care health plans and commercial insurance com- panies were recorded on an accrual basis in the period in which services were provided at estab- lished rates. The Company has entered into sub-capitation and other shared savings arrangements with cer- tain payors to provide care to certain ESRD and chronic kidney disease patients. Under these arrangements, a baseline per patient per month amount is established. If the Company provides complete care for less than the baseline, it retains the difference. If the cost of complete care exceeds the baseline, the Company may owe the payor the difference. In the U.S., the Company generates revenue from insurance contracts in accordance with IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4). Insurance premium revenue is recognized as earned each month and risk adjustments are offset against revenue. Prior to January 1, 2019, in the U.S the Company provided Medicare Advantage ESRD Chronic Conditions Special Needs Plan products. These were Medicare Advantage health plans offered by the Company that contracted with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide patients with Medicare benefits and receive capitated payments from CMS. Revenue from insurance contracts is disclosed as part of Other revenue separately from Rev- enue from contracts with customers in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Health care products In the health care product business, major revenues are generated from the sale of dialysis machines and water treatment systems, home hemodialysis products, disposable products and maintenance agreements for the Company s health care products. Revenues from the sale of dialysis machines and water treatment system are typically recognized upon installation and provision of the necessary technical instructions as only thereafter the customer obtains control of the medical device. A small portion of the Company s revenue is recognized from sales of dialysis machines, home hemodialysis products and other products used for in-center hemodial- ysis treatment to distributors. When the distributor is the principal in the contract, the revenue allocated to the machine or the products will be recognized upon transfer of control to the dis- tributor. In case the Company is committed to perform the installation, revenue allocated to the installation, as a separate performance obligation, would be recorded upon installation of the machine at the end-customers premises. In case the distributor is only an agent in the contract, revenue for sale of the machine would be recorded upon installation. Under consignment arrangements revenue is recognized upon withdrawal of the products by the customer. Maintenance is provided over time, and as such revenue is typically recognized on a straight-line basis as the customer is simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits provided by the Companys performance. All other dialysis and non-dialysis product revenues are recognized upon transfer of control to the customer. Product revenues are normally based upon pre-determined rates that are estab- lished by contractual arrangement. A portion of dialysis product revenues is generated from arrangements which give the customer, typically a health care provider, the right to use dialysis machines. In the same contract the cus- tomer agrees to purchase the related treatment disposables at a price marked up from the stan- dard price list. If the right to use the machine is conveyed through an operating lease and the customer agrees to purchase a minimum number of related treatment disposables, FMC AG & Co. KGaA does not recognize revenue upon delivery of the dialysis machine but recognizes revenue on the sale of disposables upon transfer of control with revenue for the use of dialysis machines recognized straight-line over the term of the lease contract. When there is no such agreement that the customer purchases a minimum number of related treatment disposables, revenue is recognized only on the sale of disposables unless the timing of the first purchase order of related treatment disposables justifies a combination of contracts according to IFRS 15. If the lease of the machines is a finance lease, ownership of the dialysis machine is transferred to the user upon installation of the dialysis machine at the customer site. In this type of contract, revenue is recognized in accordance with the accounting principles for finance leases under IFRS 16. The allocation of the transaction price to lease and non-lease components is based on stand-alone selling prices. For certain home-dialysis products the Company offers month-to month rental arrangements, where revenue is recognized on a monthly basis. In addition, for some licensing agreements and equipment sales to dialysis clinic customers in the area of home-dialysis, the Company recognizes upfront fees received as lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. IFRS 15 specifically excludes leases from the scope of the revenue standard. The transaction price of contracts which include lease components is allocated in accordance with IFRS 15. Reve- nue is recognized separately for the lease and the non-lease components of the contract. Revenue from lease contracts is disclosed as part of Other revenue separately from Revenue from contracts with customers in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. L) Capitalized interest The Company includes capitalized interest as part of the cost of the asset if it is directly attribut- able to the acquisition, construction or manufacture of qualifying assets. For the fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, interest of 4,963, 7,240 and 5,724, based on an average interest rate of 3.67 %, 3.84 % and 4.03 %, respectively, was recognized as a component of the cost of assets. M) Research and development expenses Research is the original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge. Development is the technical and commercial implementation of research results and takes place before the start of commercial production or use. Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs that fully meet the criteria for the recogni- tion of an intangible asset set out in IAS 38, Intangible Assets (IAS 38) are capitalized as intan- gible asset. N) Income taxes Current taxes are calculated based on the profit (loss) of the fiscal year and in accordance with local tax rules of the respective tax jurisdictions. Expected and executed additional tax payments and tax refunds for prior years are also taken into account. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the single entitys financial statement carrying amounts of exist- ing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, tax credits and tax loss carryforwards which are probable to be utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period. A change in tax rate for the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period the new laws are enacted or substantively enacted. The effects of the adjustment are gen- erally recognized in the income statement. The effects of the adjustment are recognized in equity, if the temporary differences are related to items directly recognized in equity. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recog- nition of an asset or a liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. The carrying amount of a deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognized to the extent that the utilization of parts or all of it is probable because sufficient taxable profit will be available (See NOTe 4 H). The determination of future taxable income is based on assumptions on future market conditions and future profits of FMC AG & Co. KGaA and considers all currently available information as well as the level of historical taxable income. In addition, the determination of the recoverable amount of deferred tax assets consid- ers implemented tax strategies. The Company recognizes assets and liabilities for uncertain tax treatments to the extent it is probable the tax will be recovered or that the tax will be payable, respectively. In North America and Germany, interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncer- tain tax treatments, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore are accounted for under IAS 37. All other jurisdictions account for interest and penalties related to income taxes in accordance with local tax rules of the respective tax jurisdiction either under IAS 37 or as income tax expense under IAS 12. O) Impairment The Company reviews the carrying amount of its property, plant and equipment, its intangible assets with definite useful lives, its right-of-use assets as well as other non-current assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount is higher than the assets recoverable amount in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets (IAS 36). The fair value less cost of disposal of an asset is estimated as its net realizable value. The value in use is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the rele- vant asset. If it is not possible to estimate the future cash flows from the individual assets, impair- ment is tested on the basis of the corresponding group of CGUs. Impairment losses, except impairment losses recognized on goodwill, are reversed up to the amount of the amortized acquisition cost, as soon as the reasons for impairment no longer exist. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell and depreciation is ceased. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are considered to be held and used until disposal. P) Debt issuance costs Debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. These costs are amortized over the term of the related obligation (See NOTe 14). Q) Self-insurance programs See NOTe 2 D. R) Concentration of risk The Company is engaged in the manufacture and sale of products for all forms of kidney dialysis, principally to health care providers throughout the world, and in providing kidney dialysis treat- ment. The Company also provides additional health care services under Care Coordination. The Company performs ongoing evaluations of its customers financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral. Revenues which were earned and subject to regulations under Medicare and Medicaid, govern- mental health care programs administered by the U.S. government, were approximately 32 %, 33 %, and 33 % of the Companys worldwide revenues in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See NOTe 2 C for concentration risks of debtors or group of debtors as well as NOTe 8 for discus- sion of suppliers with long-term purchase commitments. S) Legal contingencies See NOTe 2 B. T) Other provisions In accordance with IAS 12 and IAS 37, accruals for taxes and other obligations are recognized when there is a present obligation to a third party arising from past events, it is probable that the obligation will be settled in the future and the required amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions by their nature are more uncertain than most other items in the statement of finan- cial position. Tax accruals include obligations for the current year and for prior periods. Non-current provisions with a remaining period of more than one year are discounted to the present value of the expenditures expected to settle the obligation. The applied discount rate is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. U) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated in accordance with IAS 33, Earnings per Share (IAS 33). Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share include the effect of all potentially dilutive instruments on shares that would have been out- standing during the years presented had the dilutive instruments been issued. For the calculation of basic earnings per share, treasury stock is not considered outstanding and is therefore deducted from the number of shares outstanding. Equity-settled awards granted under the Companys stock incentive plans (See NOTe 20), are potentially dilutive equity instruments. V) Treasury stock The Company may, from time to time, acquire its own shares (Treasury Stock) as approved by its shareholders. The acquisition, sale or retirement of its Treasury Stock is recorded separately in equity. The value of such Treasury Stock is shown as a reduction of the Companys equity. W) Employee benefit plans Pension obligations for post-employment benefits are measured in accordance with IAS 19 (revised 2011), Employee Benefits (IAS 19), using the projected unit credit method, taking into account future salary and trends for pension increase. The Company uses December 31 as the measurement date when measuring the net pension liability. For the Companys funded benefit plans the defined benefit obligation is offset against the fair value of plan assets (net pension liability). Plan assets comprise assets held by a long-term employee benefit fund and qualifying insurance policies. A pension liability is recognized in the consolidated balance sheet if the defined benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets. A pension asset is recognized (and reported under Other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheet) if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the defined benefit obliga- tion and if the Company has a right of refund against the fund or a right to reduce future pay- ments to the fund. Net interest costs are calculated by multiplying the benefit obligation (fair value of plan assets) at beginning of the year with the discount rate utilized in determining the benefit obligation. Remeasurements include actuarial gains and losses resulting from the evaluation of the defined benefit obligation as well as from the difference between actual investment returns and the return implied by the net interest cost. In the event of a surplus for a defined benefit pension plan remeasurements can also contain the effect from asset ceiling, as far as this effect is not included in net interest costs. Remeasurements are recognized in AOCI completely. Remeasurements may not be reclassified in subsequent periods. Components of net periodic benefit cost are recognized in profit and loss of the period. X) Share-based plans The grant date fair value of stock options and convertible equity instruments that are settled by delivering equity instruments granted to the Management Board and executive employees of the Company and its subsidiaries by FMC AG & Co. KGaA is measured in accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based Payment (IFRS 2) using the binominal option pricing model and recognized as expense over the vesting period of the stock option plans. For certain exceptions, as defined in the respective plan terms, a shorter vesting period may apply after which the stock options will not forfeit in any way. In such cases the vesting period is shortened accordingly. The balance sheet date fair value of cash-settled phantom stock granted to the Management Board and executive employees of the Company is calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 using the binominal option pricing model. The corresponding liability based on the balance sheet date fair value is accrued over the vesting period of the phantom stock plans. For certain exceptions as defined in the respective plan terms, a shorter vesting period may apply after which the phantom stock will not forfeit in any way. In such cases the vesting period is shortened accordingly. The balance sheet date fair value of cash-settled performance shares granted to the Manage- ment Board and executive employees of the Company is calculated using the Monte Carlo pricing model in accordance with IFRS 2. The corresponding liability based on the balance sheet date fair value is accrued over the vesting periods of the performance share plans. For certain exceptions a shorter vesting period may apply after which the performance shares will not forfeit in any way. In such cases the vesting period is shortened accordingly. Y) Government grants In accordance with IAS 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, government grants, including non-monetary grants at fair value, are recognized only when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with all conditions attached to the grant and that the grants will be received. Government grants or government assistance are recognized directly against the respective qualifying expense in either the cost of revenue line item or selling, general and administrative expense line item within the statement of profit and loss. Amounts received for which a respective cost is not yet incurred are recorded as a liability on the Companys consolidated balance sheet and offset against all qualifying costs that are incurred in future periods. The Company and its patient population have been impacted by severe acute respiratory syn- drome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19). On March 27, 2020, the U.S. administration signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) which provides relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers in connection with the impact of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. The Company currently esti- mates that all funds received from grants comply with the terms and conditions associated with the funding received. Additional guidance may be released from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services with regards to the application of CARES Act relief funds which could affect the Companys estimate as of December 31, 2020. All funding received under the CARES Act in the U.S. is to be applied solely to the Companys U.S. operations. In accordance with the condi- tions of the funding received under the grants, the Company is obliged and committed to fulfill- ing all the requirements of the grant funding arrangements in the respective jurisdictions in which funding was received. The Company has determined that there is reasonable assurance that it will continue to be entitled to the amounts received and comply with the requirements related to the grants. Z) Recent pronouncements Recently implemented accounting pronouncements The Company has prepared its consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with IFRS that have to be applied for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, there were no recently implemented accounting pronouncements that had a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted The IASB issued the following new standards which are relevant for the Company: IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts. IFRS 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure related to the issuance of insurance con- tracts. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, which was brought in as an interim standard in 2004. IFRS 4 permitted the use of national accounting standards for the accounting of insur- ance contracts under IFRS. As a result of the varied application for insurance contracts there was a lack of comparability among peer groups. IFRS 17 eliminates this diversity in practice by requir- ing all insurance contracts to be accounted for using current values. The frequent updates to the insurance values are expected to provide more useful information to users of financial state- ments. On June 25, 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17, which among others, defer the effective date to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Earlier adoption is permitted for entities that have also adopted IFRS 9, Financial Instruments and IFRS 15, Revenue from Con- tracts with Customers. The Company is evaluating the impact of IFRS 17 on the consolidated financial statements. Amendments to IAS 1, Classification of Liabilities as Current and Non-current In January 2020, the IASB issued Amendments to IAS 1, Classification of Liabilities as Current and Non-current. The amendments clarify under which circumstances debt and other liabilities with an uncertain settlement date should be classified as current or non-current. Among others, the amendments state that liabilities shall be classified depending on rights that exist at the end of the reporting period and define under which conditions liabilities might be settled by cash, other economic resources or equity. On July 15th, 2020, the IASB deferred the effective date by one year to provide companies with more time to implement any classification changes resulting from the amendments. The Amend- ments to IAS 1 are now effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Earlier adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the amendments to IAS 1 on the consolidated financial statements. In the Companys view, no other pronouncements issued by the IASB are expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The EU Commissions endorsements of IFRS 17 and of the amendments to IAS 1 are still outstanding. 2. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTIES The Companys reported results of operations, financial position and net assets are sensitive to significant judgments, assumptions and estimates that are the basis for its financial statements. The critical accounting policies, the judgments made in the creation and application of these policies and the sensitivities of reported results to changes in accounting policies, significant judgments and estimates are factors to be considered along with the Companys financial state- ments. In the opinion of the Management of the Company, the following accounting policies, significant judgments and sources of estimation uncertainties are critical for the consolidated financial statements in the present economic environment. A) Recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets The growth of the business through acquisitions has created a significant amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, trade names, management contracts, non-compete agreements, tech- nology and customer relationships as well as licenses and distribution agreements. In addition, the Company recognizes internally developed intangible assets related to research and develop- ment and software development projects. At December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of good- will and non-amortizable intangible assets amounted to 13,168,605 (14,247,709 at Decem- ber 31, 2019) representing approximately 42 % and 43 % of the Companys total assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In accordance with IAS 36, the Company performs an impairment test of goodwill and non-amor- tizable intangible assets at least once a year for each group of CGUs or more frequently if the Company becomes aware of events that occur or if circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable (See aLSO NOTe 1 g). To comply with IFRS to determine possible impairments of these assets, the value in use of the group of CGUs is first compared to the group of CGUs carrying amount. In cases where the value in use of the group of CGUs is less than its carrying amount and the fair value less cost of disposal is not estimated to be higher than the value in use, the difference is recorded as an impairment of the carrying amount of the group of CGUs. The value in use of each group of CGUs is determined using estimated future cash flows for the unit discounted by a pre-tax discount rate (WACC) specific to that group of CGUs. The Companys WACC consists of a basic rate adjusted by a weighted average country risk rate and, if appropri- ate, by a factor to reflect higher risks associated with the cash flows from recent material acqui- sitions within each group of CGUs, until they are appropriately integrated. Estimating the future cash flows involves significant assumptions, especially regarding future reimbursement rates and sales prices, number of treatments, sales volumes and costs. The key assumptions represent managements assessment of future trends and have been based on historical data from both external and internal sources. In determining discounted cash flows, the Company utilizes for every group of CGUs its three-year budget, projections for years four to ten and a representative growth rate for all remaining years. Projections for up to ten years are possible due to the non-discretionary nature of the health care services the Company provides, the need for health T 5.10 KEY ASSUMPTIONS IN % North America 1 EMEA Asia-Pacific 1 Latin America 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Average revenue growth in ten year projection period mid-single-digit mid-single-digit mid-single-digit mid-single-digit mid-single-digit high-single-digit mid-single-digit mid-single-digit Residual value growth 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 4.00 4.00 1.60 2.95 Pre-tax WACC 6.42 7.71 8.64 8.73 6.40 6.79 13.29  24.28 10.45  20.02 After-tax WACC 5.08 6.00 6.21 6.25 5.65 6.04 9.14  20.13 8.06  17.63 1 There are no reasonably possible changes in assumptions that would lead to an impairment in these groups of CGUs. care products utilized to provide such services and the availability of government reimbursement for a substantial portion of its services. TaBLe 5.10 ON page 169 shows the key assumptions of value-in-use calculations. T 5.11 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS CHaNge IN peRCe NTage pOINTS EMEA An overview of the carrying amounts of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful life for each group of CGUs is shown in NOTe 11. To evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, the Company compares the recoverable amount of intangible assets with their carrying values and an intangible assets recoverable amount is determined using a dis- counted cash flow approach or other methods, if appropriate. A prolonged downturn in the health care industry with lower than expected increases in reim- bursement rates and / or higher than expected costs for providing health care services and for procuring and selling health care products or a significant increase of mortality of patients with chronic kidney diseases which may be attributable to COVID-19 could adversely affect the Com- panys estimated future cash flows. Future adverse changes in a cash-generating units economic environment of a group of CGUs could affect the country specific risk rate and therefore the dis- count rate. Equally an increase of the general interest rate level could affect the base rate and therefore the discount rate. A decrease in the estimated future cash flows and / or a decline in the cash-generating units economic environment could result in impairment charges to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful life which could materially and adversely affect the Companys future financial position and operating results. In 2020, as a result of the annual impairment test of goodwill, the Latin America group of CGUs recognized an impairment of goodwill in the amount of 193,978 and trade names in the amount of 490 to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and trade names (Impairment Loss). The impairment was driven by a macro-economic downturn and increasing risk adjustment rates for certain countries in Latin America. Additionally, the recoverable amount of the EMEA group of CGUs exceeds the carrying amount by 492,736. TaBLe 5.11 shows the reasonable amounts by which the key assumptions would need to change individually that the recoverable amount equals the carrying amount. B) Legal contingencies From time to time, during the ordinary course of operations as well as due to acquisitions, the Company is party to litigation and arbitration and is subject to investigations relating to various aspects of its business (See NOTe 22). The Company regularly analyzes current information about such claims for probable losses and provides accruals for such matters, including the estimated legal expenses and consulting services in connection with these matters, as appropriate. The Company utilizes its internal legal department as well as external resources for these assess- ments. In making the decision regarding the need for loss accrual, the Company considers the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and its ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. The filing of a suit or formal assertion of a claim or assessment, or the disclosure of any such suit or assertion, does not necessarily indicate that accrual of a loss is appropriate. The outcome of these matters may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and net assets of the Company. C) Trade accounts and other receivables from unrelated parties and expected credit losses Trade accounts and other receivables from unrelated parties are a substantial asset of the Company and the expected credit losses are based upon a significant estimate made by manage- ment. Trade accounts and other receivables from unrelated parties were 3,153,045 and 3,421,346 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, net of expected credit losses of 142,372 at December 31, 2020 and 141,358 at December 31, 2019. The Company sells health care products directly or through distributors in around 150 countries and provides health care services in around 50 countries. Most payors are government institu- tions or government-sponsored programs with significant variations between the countries and even between payors within one country in local payment and collection practices. Receivables resulting from health care services are recognized and billed at amounts estimated to be collectable under government reimbursement programs and reimbursement arrangements with third party payors. U.S. Medicare and Medicaid government programs are billed at pre- determined net realizable rates per treatment that are established by statute or regulation. Revenues for non-governmental payors with which the Company has contracts or letters of agreement in place are recognized at the prevailing contract rates. The remaining non-govern- mental payors are billed at the Companys standard rates for services and, in the Companys North America Segment, a contractual adjustment is recorded to recognize revenues based on historic reimbursement. The contractual adjustment and the expected credit losses are reviewed quarterly for their adequacy. No material changes in estimates were recorded for the contractual allowance in the periods presented. The collectability of receivables is reviewed locally on a regular basis, generally monthly. For further information, See NOTe 1 K. In the Companys North America Segment operations, the collection process is usually initiated shortly after service is provided or upon the expiration of the time provided by contract. For Medicare and Medicaid, once the services are approved for payment, the collection process begins upon the expiration of a period of time based upon experience with Medicare and Medic- aid. In all cases where co-payment is required the collection process usually begins within 30 days after service has been provided. In those cases where claims are approved for amounts less than anticipated or if claims are denied, the collection process usually begins upon notice of approval of the lesser amounts or upon denial of the claim. The collection process can be confined to inter- nal efforts, including the accounting and sales staffs and, where appropriate, local management staff. If appropriate, external collection agencies may be engaged. Public health institutions in a number of countries outside the U.S. require a significant amount of time until payment is made because a substantial number of payors are government entities whose payments are often determined by local laws and regulations and budget constraints. Depending on local facts and circumstances, the period of time to collect can be quite lengthy. In those instances where there are commercial payors, the same type of collection process is initi- ated as in the North America Segment. Due to the number of subsidiaries and different countries that the Company operates in, the Companys policy of determining when an individual expected credit loss is required considers the appropriate individual local facts and circumstances that apply to an account. While payment and collection practices vary significantly between countries and even agencies within one coun- try, government payors usually represent low to moderate credit risks. It is the Companys policy to determine when receivables should be classified as bad debt on a local basis taking into account local payment practices and local collection experience. An individual expected credit loss is calculated locally if specific circumstances indicate that amounts will not be collectible. Receivables where the expected credit losses are not assessed individually are grouped based on geographical regions and the impairment is assessed based on macroeconomic indicators such as credit default swaps. For more information regarding the impairment on trade accounts and other receivables from unrelated parties please refer to NOTe 1 I. When all efforts to collect a receivable, including the use of outside sources where required and allowed, have been exhausted, and after appropriate management review, a receivable deemed to be uncollectible is considered a bad debt and written off. Write offs are taken on a claim-by-claim basis. Due to the fact that a large portion of its reim- bursement is provided by public health care organizations and private insurers, the Company expects that most of its accounts receivables will be collectible, albeit potentially more slowly outside the North America Segment. A significant change in the Companys collection experi- ence, deterioration in the aging of receivables and collection difficulties could require that the Company increases its estimate of the expected credit losses. Any such additional bad debt charges could materially and adversely affect the Companys future operating results. If, in addition to the Companys existing expected credit losses, 1 % of the gross amount of the Companys trade accounts and other receivables from unrelated parties as of December 31, 2020 were uncollectible through either a change in the Companys estimated contractual adjustment or revised estimate of the collectability, the Companys operating income for 2020 would have been reduced by approximately 1.4 %. TaBLe 5.12 ON page 172 shows the portion of major debtors or debtor groups of trade accounts and other receivables from unrelated parties as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Other than U.S. Medicare and Medicaid, no single debtor accounted for more than 5 % of total trade accounts and other receivables from unrelated parties in any of these years. T 5.12 COMPOSITION OF TRADE ACCOUNTS AND OTHER RECEIVABLES FROM UNRELATED PARTIES December 31, December 31, 2020 2019 U.S. Government health care programs 30 % 30 % U.S. commercial payors 14 % 15 % U.S. hospitals 5 % 4 % Self-pay of U.S. patients 3 % 2 % Other North America Segment payors 2 % 4 % Product customers and health care payors outside the North America Segment 46 % 45 % TOTAL 100 % 100 % D) Self-insurance programs Under the Companys insurance programs for professional, product and general liability, auto lia- bility, workers compensation and medical malpractice claims, the Companys largest subsidiary which is located in the U.S. is partially self-insured for professional liability claims. For all other coverages, the Company assumes responsibility for incurred claims up to predetermined amounts above which third party insurance applies. Reported liabilities for the year represent estimated future payments of the anticipated expense for claims incurred (both reported and incurred but not reported) based on historical experience and existing claim activity. This experience includes both the rate of claims incidence (number) and claim severity (cost) and is combined with individ- ual claim expectations to estimate the reported amounts. E) Level 3 financial instruments Put option liabilities, variable payments outstanding for acquisitions and equity investments are recognized at their fair value. Each put option contract contains specific clauses related to the terms of exercisability, which require significant judgment in order to determine appropriate lia- bility recognition and classification. For further information related to the significant judgments and estimates related to these instruments and their fair values, See NOTeS 1 H aND 23. F) Income taxes The Company is subject to ongoing and future tax audits in the U.S., Germany and other jurisdic- tions. Different interpretations of tax laws may lead to potential additional tax payments or tax refunds for prior years. To consider income tax provisions or income tax receivables of uncertain tax assessments managements estimations are based on local tax rules of the respective tax jurisdiction and the interpretation of such. Estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the assumption. For further information to estimates related to the recoverability of deferred taxes, See NOTeS 1 N aND 4 H. G) Business combinations The Company measures the noncontrolling interest in an acquisition at fair value and classifies costs related to its business combinations within general and administrative expense. In deter- mining whether an intangible asset related to a business combination is identifiable and should be separated from goodwill, significant judgment is required. Additionally, estimation of the acquisition-date fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed also involves significant judgment. The applicable measurements and inputs used in this estimation (including revenue growth rates, gross profit margin adjusted for synergy assumptions associated with manufacturing savings and the discount rate) are based upon information available at the acqui- sition date using expectations and assumptions that management deems reasonable. Such judg- ments, estimates and assumptions could materially affect the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition, primarily due to:  Fair values assigned to assets subject to depreciation and amortization directly impact the depreciation and amortization recorded in the Companys consolidated statements of income in periods subsequent to a related acquisition.  Any subsequent measurement resulting in a decrease in the estimated fair values of assets acquired may result in impairment.  Subsequent changes resulting in an increase or decrease to the estimated fair values of liabi- lities assumed may result in additional expense or income, respectively. For further information on business combinations, See NOTe 3. 3. ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING DEBT SECURITIES), PURCHASES OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, DIVESTITURES AND SALE OF DEBT SECURITIES The Company completed acquisitions, investments (including debt securities) and the purchase of intangible assets in the amount of 406,644, 2,297,173 and 956,803 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, 355,386 was paid in cash and 51,258 were assumed obligations and non-cash consideration. In 2019, 2,232,671 was paid in cash and 64,502 were assumed obligations and non-cash consideration. In 2018, 925,267 was paid in cash and 31,536 were assumed obligations and non-cash consideration. Acquisitions The Company made acquisitions of 265,612, 2,224,599 and 280,643 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively in order to expand the scope of its services and to increase its market shares in the respective countries. In 2020, 214,836 was paid in cash and 50,776 were assumed obligations and non-cash consideration. In 2019, 2,160,097 was paid in cash and 64,502 were assumed obligations and non-cash consideration. In 2018, 249,965 was paid in cash and 30,678 were assumed obligations and non-cash consideration. The Companys acquisition spending was driven primarily by the purchase of dialysis clinics in the normal course of its operations in 2020, 2019 and 2018 as well as the acquisition of NxStage Medical, Inc. (NxStage) in 2019. Impacts on consolidated financial statements from acquisitions The assets and liabilities of all acquisitions were recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition and are included in the Companys financial statements and operating results from the effective date of acquisition. The measurement period adjustments from the previous years acquisitions did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements in 2020. The excess of the total acquisition costs over the fair value of the net assets acquired resulted in goodwill of 258,544 and 1,607,559 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The purchase price allocations for all collectively and individually non-material acquisitions for 2020 are not yet finalized. The Company is in the process of obtaining and evaluating the infor- mation necessary for the purchase price allocations, primarily related to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, accounts receivable and other liabilities. In 2020, based on prelim- inary purchase price allocations, the Company recorded 258,544 of goodwill and 19,507 of intangible assets, which represent the share of both controlling and noncontrolling interests. Goodwill arose principally due to the fair value of the established streams of future cash flows for these acquisitions. Business combinations during 2020 increased the Companys net income (net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA) by 2,749, excluding the costs of the acquisitions, and revenue increased by 62,072. Total assets increased 337,300 due to busi- ness combinations. Acquisition of NxStage Medical, Inc. On February 21, 2019, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of NxStage for $30.00 (26.42) per common share. The total acquisition value of this business combination, net of cash acquired, was $1,976,235 (1,740,563 at date of closing). NxStage is a medical technology com- pany that develops, produces and markets an innovative product portfolio of medical devices for use in home dialysis and in the critical care setting. This acquisition was part of the Companys stated strategy to expand and complement its existing business through acquisitions. Generally, these acquisitions do not change the Companys business model and can be integrated without disruption to its existing business, requiring little or no realignment of its structures. The NxStage acquisition was consistent in this regard as it supplemented the Companys existing business. TaBLe 5.13 ON page 174 summarizes the fair values, as of the date of acquisition based upon infor- mation available, as of December 31, 2019, of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition.

Goodwill in the amount of $1,201,613 (1,058,317) was acquired as part of the NxStage acquisition and is allocated to the North America Segment. NxStages results have been included in the Companys consolidated statement of income since February 21, 2019. Specifically, NxStage has contributed revenue and an operating loss in the amount of $294,281 (262,875) and $31,145 (27,821) respectively, to the Companys consoli- dated operating income in 2019. This operating loss amount does not include synergies which may have resulted at consolidated entities outside NxStage since the acquisition closed. Diluted earnings per share 3.92 Investments (including debt securities) and purchases of intangible assets Investments (including debt securities) and purchases of intangible assets were 141,032, 72,574 and 676,160 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts were primarily driven by investments in debt securities in 2020, investments in debt securities as well as equity invest- ments in 2019 as well as investments in debt securities and an equity investment in Humacyte, Inc. (Humacyte) in 2018. Of this amount 140,550, 72,574 and 675,302 were paid in cash in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Divestitures and sale of debt securities Proceeds from divestitures and sale of debt securities were 77,509, 79,427 and 1,683,292 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts mainly related to the divestment of debt securities and certain research & development investments in 2020, divestment of MedSpring Urgent Care Centers in Texas, a California based cardiovascular business, sales of debt securi- ties as well as B.Braun Medical Inc.s purchase of NxStages bloodlines business in connection with our acquisition of NxStage in 2019, the divestiture of the controlling interest in Sound (See NOTeS 4 C aND 25) as well as divestitures of debt securities in 2018. In 2020, 56,849 was received in cash and 20,660 were non-cash components. In 2019, 59,940 was received in cash and 19,487 were non-cash components. In 2018, 1,682,975 was received in cash and 317 were non-cash components. 4.

The tax effects of the temporary differences and net operating losses that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019, are presented in TaBLe 5.24. In the consolidated balance sheets, the accumulated amounts of deferred tax assets and liabili- ties are shown in TaBLe 5.25.

This is due to deferred taxes that are booked directly to equity, the effects of exchange rate changes on tax assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than euro, the acquisition and disposal of entities as part of ordinary activities and the reclassification of deferred tax assets and liabilities which are presented on the face of the bal- ance sheet as components of other assets and liabilities. The net operating losses included in TaBLe 5.26 ON page 180 reflect U.S. federal tax, German corporate income tax, and other tax loss carryforwards in the various countries in which the Company operates, and expire. Included in the balance of net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2020 are 218,710 not expected to be absorbed. Deferred tax assets regarding this portion are not recognized. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers to which extent it is probable that the deferred tax asset will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards become deductible. Management con- siders the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, manage- ment believes it is probable the Company will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020.

At December 31, 2020, the Company provided for 7,353 (2019: 6,645) of deferred tax liabilities associated with earnings that are likely to be distributed in 2021 and the following years. Provision has not been made for additional taxes on 8,747,019 (2019: 8,867,422) undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as these earnings are consid- ered indefinitely reinvested. The earnings could become subject to additional tax if remitted or deemed remitted as dividends; however, calculation of such additional tax is not practicable. These taxes would predominantly comprise foreign withholding tax on dividends of foreign sub- sidiaries, and German income tax; however, those dividends and capital gains would generally be 95 % tax free for German tax purposes. I) Impacts of COVID-19 The Company provides life-sustaining dialysis treatments and other critical healthcare services and products to patients. Its patients need regular and frequent dialysis treatments, or else they face significant health consequences that would result in either hospitalization or death. To be able to continue care for its patients in light of COVID-19, the Company determined that it needed to implement a number of measures, both operational and financial, to maintain an adequate workforce, protect its patients and employees through expanded personal protective equipment protocols and to develop surge capacity for patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. Additionally, the Company experienced a loss of revenue due to the pandemic in certain parts of its business, offset by increased demand for its services and products in other parts. Various governments in regions in which the Company operates have provided economic assistance programs to address the consequences of the pandemic on companies and support healthcare providers and patients. The Company has recorded 251,662 of related reimbursement payments and funding. In addi- tion to the costs incurred which are eligible for government funding in various countries, the Company has been affected by impacts that COVID-19 had on the global economy and financial markets as well as effects related to lockdowns. At the same time the Company incurred lower costs in certain areas, for example for travel. Overall, including COVID-19 reimbursements, the Company concluded that COVID-19 resulted in an immaterial impact to net income attributable to shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company received U.S. federal relief funding under the CARES Act in the amount of $284,600 (249,168 for the year ended December 31, 2020). Additionally, the Company recorded a contract liability for advance payments received under the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payment program within current provisions and other current liabilities and non-current provisions and other non-current liabilities in the amount of 852,437 as of December 31, 2020.

T 5.49 AMENDED 2012 CREDIT AGREEMENT - MAXIMUM AMOUNT AVAILABLE AND BALANCE OUTSTANDING IN THOUS The Company originally entered into a syndicated credit facility of $3,850,000 (2,970,221) and a 5-year tenor (the 2012 Credit Agreement) on October 30, 2012. On November 26, 2014, the 2012 Credit Agreement was amended to increase the total credit facility to approximately Maximum amount available 2019 Balance outstanding 2019 1 $4,400,000 (3,527,054) and extend the term for an additional two years until October 30, 2019 (Amended 2012 Credit Agreement). On July 11, 2017, the Company further amended and extended the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement. See TaBLe 5.49. Interest on the credit facilities is floating at a rate equal to EURIBOR / LIBOR (as applicable) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is variable and depends on the Companys consoli- dated net leverage ratio, which is a ratio of its consolidated funded debt less cash and cash equiv- alents to consolidated EBITDA (as these terms are defined in the Amended 2012 Credit Agree- ment).

The limitation on incurrence of debt in the bonds issued before 2018 was suspended automatically as the rating of the respective bonds reached investment grade status. At Decem- ber 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the bonds. Since 2018, bonds can be issued with different maturities under the Companys 10,000,000 Debt Issuance Program (Debt Issuance Program). On May 29, 2020, the Company issued bonds in two tranches with an aggregate principal amount of 1,250,000 under the Debt Issuance Program:  bonds of 500,000 with a maturity of 6 years and a coupon of 1.000 %, and  bonds of 750,000 with a maturity of 10 years and a coupon of 1.500 % On September 16, 2020, Fresenius Medical Care US Finance III, Inc. issued bonds with a volume of $1,000,000 (842,531). The bonds have a maturity of 10 years and 5 months and a coupon of 2.375 %. The proceeds of both the euro and the U.S. dollar issuances were used for general corporate purposes and the refinancing of existing liabilities. The bonds issued by Fresenius Medical Care US Finance II, Inc. in the amount of $500,000 (392,557 as of the date of issuance on October 29, 2014) originally due on October 15, 2020, were redeemed prior to maturity on July 17, 2020. Convertible bonds On September 19, 2014, the Company issued 400,000 principal amount of equity-neutral con- vertible bonds with a coupon of 1.125 %. The bonds were issued at par and repaid as planned on January 31, 2020. In November 2019, the conversion feature expired and no conversions occurred. The call options on its shares that the Company purchased in 2014 to fully offset the economic exposure from the conversion feature also expired in November 2019. Accounts Receivable Facility The Company refinanced the Accounts Receivable Facility on December 20, 2018 increasing the facility to $900,000 (785,958) and extending it until December 20, 2021. TaBLe 5.51 shows the available and outstanding amounts under the Accounts Receivable Facility at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. T 5.51 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FACILITY - MAXIMUM AMOUNT AVAILABLE AND BALANCE OUTSTANDING IN THOUS rewards in the receivables as the percentage ownership interest assigned requires the Company to retain first loss risk in those receivables, and the Company can, at any time, recall all the then outstanding transferred interests in the accounts receivable. Consequently, the receivables remain on the Companys consolidated balance sheet and the proceeds from the transfer of percentage ownership interests are recorded as long-term debt. NMC Funding pays interest to the bank investors calculated based on the commercial paper rates for the particular tranches selected. At December 31, 2019, the average interest rate paid was 1.98 %. Refinancing fees, which include legal costs and bank fees, are amortized over the term of the facility. Other Maximum amount available 2019 1 Balance outstanding 2019 2 At December 31, 2020 and 2019, in conjunction with certain acquisitions and investments, the Company had fixed payments outstanding for acquisitions totaling approximately 33,562 and 27,611, respectively, of which 23,202 and 12,456, respectively, were classified as the current portion of long-term debt. Accounts Receivable Facility $900,000 801,139 $427,000 380,096 1 Subject to availability of sufficient accounts receivable meeting funding criteria. 2 Amounts shown are excluding debt issuance costs. At December 31, 2020, the Company is not currently utilizing the Accounts Receivable Facility and the principal cash flows related to bank investors initial investments have been returned. The Company also had letters of credit outstanding under the Accounts Receivable Facility in the amount of $12,522 at December 31, 2020 and $23,460 at December 31, 2019 (10,205 and 20,883, respectively). These letters of credit are not included above as part of the balance out- standing at December 31, 2020 and 2019; however, they reduce available borrowings under the Accounts Receivable Facility. Under the Accounts Receivable Facility, certain receivables are sold to NMC Funding Corporation (NMC Funding), a wholly-owned subsidiary. NMC Funding then assigns percentage ownership interests in the accounts receivable to certain bank investors (and their conduit affiliates). Under the terms of the Accounts Receivable Facility, NMC Funding retains the rights in the underlying cash flows of the transferred receivables. Interest is remitted to the bank investors at the end of each tranche period, however, the principal cash flows are continuously reinvested to purchase additional interests in the receivables. Furthermore, NMC Funding retains significant risks and 15. NON-CURRENT PROVISIONS AND OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES Of the total amount of non-current provisions and other non-current liabilities amounting to 931,590 at December 31, 2020 (2019: 616,916), 700,306 (2019: 219,129) are due in between more than one and three years, 104,343 (2019: 34,762) are due in between three to five years and 126,941 (2019: 363,025) are due after five years.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS General FMC AG & Co. KGaA recognizes pension costs and related pension liabilities for current and future benefits to qualified current and former employees of the Company. The Companys pension plans are structured in accordance with the differing legal, economic and fiscal circumstances in each country. The Company currently has two types of plans, defined benefit and defined contri- bution plans. In general, plan benefits in defined benefit plans are based on all or a portion of the employees years of services and final salary. Plan benefits in defined contribution plans are determined by the amount of contribution by the employee and the employer, both of which may be limited by legislation, and the returns earned on the investment of those contributions. Upon retirement under defined benefit plans, the Company is required to pay defined benefits to former employees when the defined benefits become due. Defined benefit plans may be funded or unfunded. The Company has five major defined benefit plans, one funded plan in the U.S. and one in France as well as one unfunded plan in Germany and two in France. Actuarial assumptions generally determine benefit obligations under defined benefit plans. The actuarial calculations require the use of estimates. The main factors used in the actuarial calcu- lations affecting the level of the benefit obligations are: assumptions on life expectancy, the dis- count rate and future salary and benefit levels. Under the Companys funded plans, assets are set aside to meet future payment obligations. An estimated return on the plan assets is recognized as income in the respective period. Actuarial gains and losses are generated when there are vari- ations in the actuarial assumptions and by differences between the actual and the estimated pro- jected benefit obligations and the return on plan assets for that year. The Companys pension lia- bility is impacted by these actuarial gains or losses. Under defined contribution plans, the Company pays defined contributions to an independent third party as directed by the employee during the employees service life, which satisfies all obli- gations of the Company to the employee. The employee retains all rights to the contributions made by the employee and to the vested portion of the Company paid contributions upon leaving the Company. The Company has a defined contribution plan in the U.S. Defined benefit pension plans During the first quarter of 2002 FMCH, the Companys U.S. subsidiary, curtailed its defined ben- efit and supplemental executive retirement plans. Under the curtailment amendment for sub- stantially all employees eligible to participate in the plan, benefits have been frozen as of the cur- tailment date and no additional defined benefits for future services will be earned. The Company has retained all employee benefit obligations as of the curtailment date. Each year FMCH contrib- utes at least the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. In 2020, FMCH did not have a minimum funding requirement. The Company voluntarily provided 9,901 to the defined benefit plan. Expected funding for 2021 is 1,059. The benefit obligation for all defined benefit plans at December 31, 2020, was 996,237 (2019: 976,467) which consists of the gross benefit obligation of 385,333 (2019: 399,339) for the U.S. plan and of 5,581 (2019: 5,498) for the French plan, which are partially funded by plan assets, and the benefit obligation of 593,100 (2019: 560,255) for the German unfunded plan and the benefit obligation of 12,223 (2019: 11,375) for the two French unfunded plans. In the fourth quarter of 2019, FMC North America offered a lump-sum payout for its defined benefit pension plan to former employees. This settlement reduced the benefit obligation and resulted in a gain. Controlling and managing the administration of the plan in the U.S. was delegated by the Com- pany to an administrative committee. This committee has the authority and discretion to manage the assets of the fund and to approve and adopt certain plan amendments. The board of directors of National Medical Care, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, reserves the right to approve or adopt all major plan amendments, such as termination, modification or termination of the future benefit accruals and plan mergers with other pension plans. Related to defined benefit plans the Company is exposed to certain risks. Besides general actu- arial risks, e.g. the longevity risk and the interest rate risk, the Company is exposed to market risk as well as to investment risk. TaBLe 5.53 shows the changes in benefit obligations, the changes in plan assets, the net funded position and the net liability of the pension plans. Benefits paid as shown in the changes in ben- efit obligations represent payments made from both the funded and unfunded plans while the benefits paid as shown in the changes in plan assets include only benefit payments from the Companys funded benefit plan.

At December 31, 2020, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation was 19 years (2019: 19 years). Benefit plans offered by the Company in the U.S., Germany and France contain a pension liability of 685,164 and 660,343 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The pension liability consists of a current portion of 6,923 (2019: 6,190) which is recorded in the line item Current provisions and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The non-current por- tion of 678,241 (2019: 654,153) is recorded in non-current liabilities as Pension liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020, 74,364 related to the U.S. pension plan, 593,100 related to the German plan and 17,700 related to the French plans.

The non-current pension liability of 40,261 (2019: 35,042) for these plans is recorded in non-current liabilities as Pension liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The discount rates for all plans are based upon yields of portfolios of highly rated debt instru- ments with maturities that mirror each plans benefit obligation. The Companys discount rates at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are the weighted average of these plans based upon their benefit obligations. Weighted-average assumptions that were utilized in determining benefit obligations at Decem- ber 31, 2020 and 2019 are shown in TaBLe 5.54. The sensitivity analysis was calculated based on the average duration of the pension obliga- tions determined at December 31, 2020. The calculations were performed isolated for each significant actuarial parameter, in order to show the effect on the fair value of the pension liability separately. The sensitivity analysis for compensation increases and for pension increases excludes the U.S. pension plan because it is frozen and therefore is not affected by changes from these two actu- arial assumptions. The defined benefit pension plans net periodic benefit costs are comprised of the following Expected benefit payments are as shown in TaBLe 5.58. components for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 that are shown in TaBLe 5.56.

Plan investment policy and strategy in the U.S. The Company periodically reviews the assumption for long-term expected return on pension plan assets. As part of the assumptions review, a range of reasonable expected investment returns for the pension plan as a whole was determined based on an analysis of expected future returns for each asset class weighted by the allocation of the assets. The range of returns developed relies both on forecasts, which include the actuarial firms expected long-term rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator, and on broad-market historical benchmarks for expected return, correlation, and volatility for each asset class. The Company s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 99 % of invest- ments for long-term growth and income and 1 % in cash or cash equivalents. Investment income and cash or cash equivalents are used for near-term benefit payments. Investments are gov- erned by the plan investment policy and include well diversified index funds or funds targeting index performance. The plan investment policy, utilizing a revised target investment allocation in a range around 26 % equity and 74 % fixed income investments, considers that there will be a time horizon for invested funds of more than 5 years. The total portfolio will be measured against a custom index that reflects the asset class benchmarks and the target asset allocation. The plan investment policy does not allow investments in securities of the Company or other related party securities. The performance benchmarks for the separate asset classes include: S&P 500 Index, S&P 400 Mid-Cap Index, Russell 2000 Index, MSCI EAFE Index, MSCI Emerging Markets Index, Barclays Capital Long-Corporate Bond Index, Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate High Yield Index, and Bloomberg Barclays U.S. High Yield Fallen Angel 3 % Capped Index. Defined contribution plans Most FMCH employees are eligible to join a 401(k) savings plan.

The Company will match 50 % of the employee deposit up to a maximum Company contribution of 3 % of the employees pay. The Companys total expense under this defined contribution plan for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, was 64,855, 53,290 and 53,872 respectively.

The Conditional Capital increase is only exe- cuted to the extent subscription rights were awarded under the 2011 SOP, the holders of the subscription rights exercise their right and the Company does not use treasury shares to fulfill the subscription rights, with each stock option awarded exercisable for one ordinary share (See NOTe 20). The Company has the right to deliver ordinary shares that it owns or purchases in the market in lieu of increasing capital by issuing new shares. At December 31, 2020, 3,201,074 options remained outstanding with a remaining average term of 2.35 years under the 2011 SOP. For the year ending December 31, 2020, 234,796 options had been exercised under the 2011 SOP (See NOTe 20).

On the basis of the authorization granted by the Companys AGM on May 12, 2016 to conduct a share buy-back program, on March 11, 2019, the Company announced a program to purchase up to 6.000,000 ordinary shares for an aggregate purchase amount of up to 330,000. Pursuant to this program, which expired on May 10, 2019, the Company repurchased 3,770,772 treasury shares in the period from March 12, 2019 up to and including May 10, 2019 for an average weighted stock price of 71.55 per share for the purpose of capital reduction.

Following the purchases in April 2020, a total of 14,879,979 ordinary shares remained to be purchased pursuant to the authorization granted at the 2016 AGM. On December 11, 2020, these repurchased shares were retired, together with the remaining 999,951 treasury shares acquired in 2013, in order to decrease the Companys share capital. The repurchased shares acquired pursuant to the program that expired on May 10, 2019 were retired in 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not hold treasury shares. The authorization granted by the AGM resolution of May 12, 2016 will expire on May 11, 2021. The Company does not intend to make further share repurchases pursuant to such authorization prior to its expiration. TaBLe 5.60 ON page 207 disclosure provides the number of shares acquired in the context of the share buy-back programs as well as the repurchased treasury stock. Additional paid-in capital Additional paid-in capital is comprised of the premium paid on the issue of shares and stock options, the tax effects from stock options, the compensation expense from stock options, which is recognized according to IFRS 2 as well as changes in ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in a loss of control. Retained earnings Retained earnings is comprised of earnings generated by group entities in prior years to the extent that they have not been distributed as well as changes of the put option liabilities.

The Company did not purchase any shares other than pursuant to such program. 2 The purchase price of the shares of the program beginning on June 17, 2019 is based on the volume weighted average price of the Companys shares for the period and changes in the volume weighted average price resulted in retroactive adjustments to the purchase price, even if no shares were purchased. The February adjustment, in combination with a lower number of shares purchased, resulted in a particularly high average price per share for the month. Noncontrolling interests Noncontrolling interests represent the proportion of the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries owned by minority shareholders. The Company has purchase obligations under put options held by the holders of noncontrolling interests in certain of its subsidiaries. These obligations result from contractual put options and are exercisable by the owners of the noncontrolling interests. In addition to noncontrolling interests, the related potential obligations under these put options are reclassified from equity of the Company, with no impact to the income statement, and recog- nized as a put option liability at the present value of the exercise price of the options in other current or non-current liabilities. 18. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The principle objectives of the Companys capital management strategy are to optimize the weighted average cost of capital and to achieve a balanced mix of total equity and debt. The dial- ysis industry, in which the Company has a strong market position in global, growing and largely non-cyclical markets, is characterized by stable cash flows. Due to the Companys payors mostly high credit quality, it is able to generate high, stable, predictable and sustainable cash flows. These generated cash flows allow a reasonable proportion of debt. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, total equity and debt were as shown in TaBLe 5.61. The Company is not subject to any capital requirements provided for in its Articles of Associa- tion. The Company has obligations to issue shares out of the conditional capital relating to the exercise of stock options on the basis of the existing 2011 SOP stock option plan (See NOTe 20). In 2020 and 2019, the Company conducted a share buy-back program. The repurchased shares were used solely to either reduce the registered share capital of the Company by cancellation of the acquired shares or to fulfill employee participation programs (See NOTe 17). Assuring financial flexibility is a top priority in the Companys financing strategy. This flexibility is achieved through a high degree of diversification of tenors, investors and banks. The Compa- nys maturity profile displays a broad spread of maturities with a high proportion of medium and long-term financings. In the choice of financing instruments market capacity, investor diversifi- cation, financing conditions and the existing maturity profile are taken into account (See NOTe 14). A key financial performance indicator for the Company is the net leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of net debt / EBITDA. To determine the net leverage ratio, debt and lease liabilities less cash and cash equivalents (net debt) is compared to EBITDA (adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures made during the year with a purchase price above a 50,000 threshold as defined in the Amended 2012 Credit Agreement, non-cash charges and impairment loss). At Decem- ber 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, this ratio was 2.7 and 3.2, respectively. The Companys financing structure and business model are reflected in the investment grade ratings. The Company is covered and rated investment grade by the three leading rating agen- cies, Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch (See TaBLe 5.62).

SHARE-BASED PLANS The Company accounts for its share-based plans in accordance with IFRS 2 and has as of December 31, 2020, various share-based compensation plans, which may either be equity- or cash-settled. Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA long-term incentive plans in the long-term, sustained success of the Company, successor programs were introduced. For members of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board of Management AG has approved and adopted the Fresenius Medical Care Management Board Long Term Incentive Plan 2020 (MB LTIP 2020) effective January 1, 2020. For the members of the management boards of affiliated companies and managerial staff members, the Management Board has approved and adopted the Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA Long Term Incentive Plan 2019 (LTIP 2019) effective January 1, 2019. The LTIP 2016, the NxStage LTIP, the MB LTIP 2019, the LTIP 2019 and the MB LTIP 2020 are each variable compensation programs with long-term incentive effects which grant or granted so-called Performance Shares. Performance Shares are non-equity, cash-settled virtual com- pensation instruments which may entitle plan participants to receive a cash payment depending on the achievement of pre-defined performance targets further defined below as well as the Companys share price development. TaBLe 5.64 provides an overview of these plans.

For members of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board of Management AG will, in due exercise of its discretion and taking into account the individual responsibility and performance of each Management Board member, determine an initial value for each grant for any awards to Management Board members. For plan participants other than the members of the Management Board, such determination will be made by the Management Board. The initial grant value is determined in the currency in which the respective participant receives his or her base salary at the time of the grant. In order to determine the number of Performance Shares each plan partic- T 5.65 PERFORMANCE TARGETS TO BE APPLIED FOR THE FISCAL YEAR FOR PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED IN THE FISCAL YEAR UNDER THE MB LTIP 2020 AND UNDER THE LTIP 2019 shares over a period of thirty calendar days prior to the respective grant date. The number of granted Performance Shares may change over the performance period of three years, depending on the level of achievement of the following: (i) revenue growth at constant currency (Revenue Growth), (ii) growth of the net income attributable to the shareholders of FMC Net Income Growth AG & Co. KGaA at constant currency (Net Income Growth) and (iii) return on invested capital (ROIC). For the LTIP 2019 exclusively, the level of achievement for Performance Shares granted in year 2019 may be subject to an increase if certain targets in relation to the second phase of the Companys Global Efficiency Program (GEP-II targets) and in relation to the Free Cash Flow (Free Cash Flow target) are achieved. Performance target 3: ROIC  6.5 % 200 % Revenue, net income and ROIC are determined according to the Companys consolidated reported and audited figures in Euro for the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, apply- ing the respective plan terms. Revenue Growth, Net Income Growth and the fulfillment of the GEP-II targets, for the purpose of the relevant plan, are determined at constant currency. The performance targets to be applied for the fiscal year for Performance Shares granted in the fiscal year under the MB LTIP 2020 and under the LTIP 2019 are presented in TaBLe 5.65. If Revenue Growth, Net Income Growth or ROIC range between these values, the respective degree of target achievement will be linearly interpolated between these values. For Performance Shares granted throughout 2016 to 2019, an annual target achievement level of 100 % will be reached for the Revenue Growth performance target if Revenue Growth is 7 % in each individual year of the three-year performance period; Revenue Growth of 0 % will lead to a target achievement level of 0 % and the maximum target achievement level of 200 % will be reached in case of Revenue Growth of at least 16 %. If Revenue Growth ranges between these values, the degree of target achievement will be linearly interpolated between these values. For Performance Shares granted throughout 2016 to 2019, an annual target achievement level of 100 % for the Net Income Growth performance target will be reached if Net Income Growth is 7 % in each individual year of the three-year performance period. In case of Net Income Growth of 0 %, the target achievement level will also be 0 %; the maximum target achievement of 200 % will be reached in the case of Net Income Growth of at least 14 %. Between these values, the degree of target achievement will be determined by means of linear interpolation. For ROIC, an annual target achievement level of 100 % will be reached if the target ROIC as defined for the applicable year is reached. For Performance Shares granted throughout 2016 to 2019, the target ROIC is 7.3 % for 2016, 7.5 % for 2017, 7.7 % for 2018, 7.9 % for 2019 and 8.1 % for 2020. A target achievement level of 0 % will be reached if the ROIC falls below the target ROIC for the applicable year by 0.2 percentage points or more, whereas the maximum target achievement level of 200 % will be reached if the target ROIC for the respective year is exceeded by 0.2 percentage points or more. The degree of target achievement will be determined by means of linear interpolation if the ROIC ranges between these values. In case the annual ROIC target achievement level in the third year of a performance period for Performance Shares granted throughout years 2016 to 2019 is equal to or higher than the ROIC target achievement level in each of the two previous years of such performance period, the ROIC target achievement level of the third year is deemed to be achieved for all years of the applicable performance period. For all plans, the achievement level for each of the three performance targets will be weighted annually at one-third to determine the yearly target achievement for each year of the three- year performance period. The level of overall target achievement over the three-year perfor- mance period will then be determined on the basis of the mean of these three average yearly target achievements. The overall target achievement can be in a range of 0 % to 200 %. For Performance Shares granted in fiscal year 2019 under the LTIP 2019, the overall target achieve- ment shall be increased by 20 percentage points if the GEP-II targets achievement is 100 %. Furthermore, the overall target achievement for Performance Shares granted in year 2019 under the LTIP 2019 shall be increased by 20 percentage points if the Free Cash Flow target achievement is 200 %. In case of a GEP-II targets achievement between 0 % and 100 % and a Free Cash Flow target achievement between 0 % and 200 %, the increase of the overall target achievement will be calculated by means of linear interpolation. The overall target achieve- ment shall not exceed 200 %. The number of Performance Shares granted to the plan participants at the beginning of the per- formance period will each be multiplied by the level of overall target achievement in order to determine the final number of Performance Shares. For the MB LTIP 2020, the final number of Performance Shares is generally deemed earned three years after the day of a grant. The number of such vested Performance Shares is then multiplied by the average Company share price over a period of thirty calendar days prior to the lapse of this vesting period. The respective resulting amount, which is capped in total at an amount equal- ing 400 % of the grant value received by the participant, less taxes and contributions is paid over to a credit institution which uses it for the purchase of shares of the Company on the stock exchange. The shares acquired in this way are subject to a holding period of at least one year. For plan participants of the LTIP 2019, the final number of Performance Shares is generally deemed earned three years after the day of a respective grant. The number of such vested Per- formance Shares is then multiplied by the average Company share price over a period of thirty calendar days prior to the lapse of this vesting period. The respective resulting amount, which is capped in total at an amount equaling 400 % of the grant value received by the participant, will then be paid to the plan participants as cash compensation. For the MB LTIP 2019, the final number of Performance Shares is generally deemed earned four years after the day of a respective grant. The number of such vested Performance Shares is then multiplied by the average Company share price over a period of thirty calendar days prior to the lapse of this vesting period. The resulting amount will then be paid to the plan participants as cash compensation. For plan participants of the NxStage LTIP, the final number of Performance Shares granted in February 2019 is generally deemed earned in December 2022. The number of such vested Per- formance Shares is then multiplied by the average Company share price over a period of thirty calendar days prior to the lapse of this vesting period. The resulting amount will then be paid to the plan participants as cash compensation. For plan participants of the LTIP 2016, the final number of Performance Shares is generally deemed earned four years after the day of a grant. The number of such vested Performance Shares is then multiplied by the average Company share price over a period of thirty calendar days prior to the lapse of this vesting period. The resulting amount will then be paid to the plan participants as cash compensation. During 2020, the Company awarded 159.607 Performance Shares under the MB LTIP 2020 at a measurement date weighted average fair value of 64.20 each and a total fair value of 10,247, which will be revalued if the fair value changes. The total fair value will be amortized over the vesting period. During 2020, the Company awarded 800,165 Performance Shares under the LTIP 2019 at a measurement date weighted average fair value of 64.06 each and a total fair value of 51,259, which will be revalued if the fair value changes. The total fair value will be amortized over the vesting period. During 2019, the Company awarded 114,999 Performance Shares under the MB LTIP 2019 at a measurement date weighted average fair value of 60.70 each and a total fair value of 6,980, which will be revalued if the fair value changes. The total fair value will be amortized over the vesting period. During 2019, the Company awarded 817,089 Performance Shares under the LTIP 2019 at a mea- surement date weighted average fair value of 62.16 each and a total fair value of 50,790, which will be revalued if the fair value changes. The total fair value will be amortized over the vesting period. During 2019, the Company awarded 55,978 Performance Shares under the NxStage LTIP at a measurement date weighted average fair value of 62.17 each and a total fair value of 3,480, which will be revalued if the fair value changes. The total fair value will be amortized over the vesting period. During 2018, the Company awarded 632,804 Performance Shares under the LTIP 2016 including 73,315 Performance Shares to the members of the Management Board at a measurement date weighted average fair value of 51.99 each and a total fair value of 32,900, which will be reval- ued if the fair value changes. The total fair value will be amortized over the vesting period. Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA long-term incentive program 2011 (stock options and Phantom Stock) On May 12, 2011, the 2011 SOP was established by resolution of the Companys AGM. The 2011 SOP, together with the Phantom Stock Plan 2011, which was established by resolution of the General Partners Management and supervisory boards, forms the Companys LTIP 2011. Under the LTIP 2011, participants were granted awards, which consisted of a combination of stock options and Phantom Stock. The final grant under the LTIP 2011 was made in December 2015. Awards under the LTIP 2011 were subject to a four-year vesting period. Vesting of the awards granted was sub- ject to achievement of pre-defined performance targets. The 2011 SOP was established with a conditional capital increase up to 12,000 subject to the issue of up to twelve million non-par value bearer ordinary shares with a nominal value of 1.00 per share. Stock options granted under the LTIP 2011 have an eight-year term and can be exercised for the first time after a four-year vesting period. The exercise price of stock options granted under the LTIP 2011 shall be the average stock exchange price on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange of the Com- panys shares during the 30 calendar days immediately prior to each grant date. Stock options granted under the LTIP 2011 to U.S. participants are non-qualified stock options under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Stock options under the LTIP 2011 are not transferable by a participant or a participants heirs, and may not be transferred, pledged, assigned, or disposed of otherwise. Phantom Stock awards under the LTIP 2011 entitled the holders to receive payment in euro from the Company upon exercise of the Phantom Stock. The payment per Phantom Stock in lieu of the issuance of such stock was based upon the share price on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange of one of the Companys shares on the exercise date. Phantom Stock awards had a five-year term and could be exercised for the first time after a four-year vesting period. For participants who were U.S. taxpayers, the Phantom Stock was deemed to be exercised in any event in the month of March following the end of the vesting period. New incentive bonus plan Since January 1, 2020 and under the Companys new compensation system, the issuance of awards under the New Incentive Bonus Plan (NIBP) is no longer possible. In 2019, the members of the Management Board were eligible for performance-related compensation that depended upon achievement of pre-defined targets. The targets were measured based on the adjusted net income growth attributable to the shareholders of FMC AG & Co. KGaA at constant currency (Adjusted Net Income Growth), adjusted net cash provided by (used in) operating activities after capital expenditures, before acquisitions and investments (Adjusted Free Cash Flow) in percent of revenues and adjusted operating margin (Adjusted Operating Margin), and were derived from the comparison of targeted and actually achieved figures. Targets were divided into Company level targets and those to be achieved in individual regions and areas of responsibility. Performance-related bonuses for 2019 consisted proportionately of a cash component and a cash-settled share-based component. Upon meeting the annual targets, the cash component for the year 2019 was paid in year 2020, after the consolidated financial statements for 2019 had been approved. The share-based component is subject to a three-year vesting period, although a shorter period may apply in special cases (e.g. occupational disability, retirement and employ- ment contracts which were not extended by the Company). The amount of cash for the payment relating to the share-based component shall be based on the share price of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA ordinary shares upon exercise. For each of the members of the Management Board, the amount of the achievable pay component as well as of the allocation value of the cash-settled share-based compensation was capped. Share-based compensation related to this plan for fiscal years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018 was 0, 2,623 and 3,414, respectively. Information on holdings under share-based plans At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the members of the Management Board and plan participants other than the members of the Management Board held the in TaBLe 5.66 shown Performance Shares under the share-based plans. Additional information on share-based plans TaBLe 5.67 provides reconciliations for stock options outstanding at December 31, 2020, as com- pared to December 31, 2019 and 2018. BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2020 3,201 71.50 options (December 31, 2019: 452,989) and plan participants other than the members of the Man- agement Board held 2,735,766 stock options (December 31, 2019: 3,036,000) under the 2011 SOP. Members of the Management Board did not hold any Phantom Stock under the LTIP 2011 as of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: 23,336). Plan participants other than the members of the Management Board also did not hold any Phantom Stock under the LTIP 2011 as of Decem- ber 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: 311,650). 1 The average share price at the date of exercise of the options was 67.62. 2 The average share price at the date of exercise of the options was 71.75. TaBLe 5.68 ON page 214 provides a summary of fully vested options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company received cash of 12,445, 17,014 and 43,508, respectively, from the exercise of stock options (See NOTe 17). The intrinsic value of stock options exercised for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was 4,402, 5,231 and 29,440, respectively. The compensation expense related to equity-settled stock option programs was determined based upon the fair value on the grant date and the number of stock options granted which was recognized over the four-year vesting period. In connection with the 2011 SOP, the Company incurred compensation expense of 0, 1,992 and 6,713 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Depreciation expense is allocated within costs of revenue, selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses depending upon the area in which the asset is used. Impairment losses are allocated within costs of revenue and selling, general and administrative expense, depending upon the area in which the asset is used. For a maturity analysis of lease liabilities See NOTe 23. Leasing in the consolidated statements of cash flows Total cash outflows from leases were 951,066 for the year ended December 31, 2020 (945,169 for the year ended December 31, 2019). Leases that the Company entered into as a lessee that have not yet begun as of December 31, 2020 will result in future cash outflows of 123,679 (December 31, 2019: 254,171). Potential future cash outflows resulting from purchase options of 41,215 were not reflected in the measurement of the lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020, as the exercise of the respec- tive options is not reasonably certain (December 31, 2019: 56,507). Potential future cash outflows resulting from extension options of 6,407,955 were not reflected in the measurement of the lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020, as the exercise of the respective options is not reasonably certain (December 31, 2019: 6,691,551). The major part of these potential future cash outflows relates to extension options in real estate lease agree- ments, primarily for dialysis clinics in the North America Segment. Individual lease agreements include multiple extension options. The Company uses extension options to obtain a high degree of flexibility in performing its business. These extension options held are exercisable solely by the Company. Potential future cash outflows resulting from termination options of 3,374 were not reflected in the measurement of the lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020, as the exercise of the respec- tive options is not reasonably certain (December 31, 2019: 3,493).

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Legal and regulatory matters The Company is routinely involved in claims, lawsuits, regulatory and tax audits, investigations and other legal matters arising, for the most part, in the ordinary course of its business of providing health care services and products. Legal matters that the Company currently deems to be material or noteworthy are described below. The Company records its litigation reserves for certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters to the extent that the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. For the other matters described below, the Company believes that the loss probability is remote and / or the loss or range of possible losses cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always difficult to predict accurately and outcomes that are not consistent with the Companys view of the merits can occur. The Company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously. Never- theless, it is possible that the resolution of one or more of the legal matters currently pending or threatened could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. Beginning in 2012, the Company received certain communications alleging conduct in countries outside the United States that might violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other anti-brib- ery laws. The Company conducted investigations with the assistance of outside counsel and, in a continuing dialogue, advised the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) about these investigations. The DOJ and the SEC also con- ducted their own investigations, in which the Company cooperated. In the course of this dialogue, the Company identified and reported to the DOJ and the SEC, and took remedial actions with respect to, conduct that resulted in the DOJ and the SEC seeking monetary penalties including disgorgement of profits and other remedies. This conduct revolved principally around the Companys products business in countries outside the United States. On March 29, 2019, the Company entered into a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with the DOJ and a separate agreement with the SEC intended to resolve fully and finally the U.S. government allegations against the Company arising from the investigations. Both agreements included terms starting August 2, 2019. The DOJ NPA is scheduled to terminate on August 2, 2022 and the dismissal of the SEC Order is scheduled to be on November 30, 2022. The Company paid a com- bined total in penalties and disgorgement of approximately $231,715 (205,854) to the DOJ and the SEC in connection with these agreements. The entire amount paid to the DOJ and the SEC was reserved for in charges that the Company recorded in 2017 and 2018 and announced in 2018. As part of the resolution, the Company agreed to certain self-reporting obligations and to retain an independent compliance monitor. Due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, the monitorship program faced certain delays, but the Company is working to have all its obligations under the resolution with the DOJ and SEC finalized in 2022. In 2015, the Company self-reported to the German prosecutor conduct with a potential nexus to Germany and continues to cooperate with government authorities in Germany in their review of the conduct that prompted the Companys and United States government investigations. Since 2012, the Company has made and continues to make further significant investments in its compliance and financial controls and in its compliance, legal and financial organizations. The Companys remedial actions included separation from those employees responsible for the above-mentioned conduct. The Company is dealing with post-FCPA review matters on various levels. The Company continues to be fully committed to compliance with the FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery laws. On October 30, 2020, Mexicos primary social security and health care agency filed a civil com- plaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Boston) asserting claims for common law fraud against the Company and FMCH. 2020 Civ. 11927-IT (E. D. Mass.). The allegations of the complaint rely on the Companys resolution under the FCPA. FMCH has been served and is proceeding to defend the litigation, initially by seeking dismissal based on improper venue and lack of jurisdiction. The Company has not been served. Personal injury and related litigation, including litigation by certain state government agencies, involving FMCHs acid concentrate product, labeled as Granuflo or Naturalyte, first arose in 2012. The matters remaining after judicial decisions favorable to FMCH and settlement, including most significantly the settlement in the federal multi-district personal injury litigation consum- mated in November 2017, do not present material risk. Accordingly, specific reporting on these matters has been discontinued. FMCHs insurers agreed to the settlement of the acid concentrate personal injury litigation and funded $220,000 (179,284) of the settlement fund under a reciprocal reservation of rights. FMCH accrued a net expense of $60,000 (48,896) in connection with the settlement, including legal fees and other anticipated costs. Following the settlement, FMCHs insurers in the AIG group initiated litigation against FMCH seeking to be indemnified by FMCH for their $220,000 (179,284) outlay and FMCH initiated litigation against the AIG group to recover defense and indemnifica- tion costs FMCH had borne. National Union Fire Insurance v. Fresenius Medical Care, 2016 Index No. 653108 (Supreme Court of New York for New York County). Discovery in the litigation is largely complete. The AIG group abandoned certain of its coverage claims and submitted expert reports on damages asserting that, if AIG prevails on all its remain- ing claims, it should recover $60,000 (48,896). FMCH contests all of AIGs claims and submitted expert reports supporting rights to recover $108,000 (88,012) from AIG, in addition to the $220,000 (179,284) already funded. A trial date has not been set in the matter. In August 2014, FMCH received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office (USAO) for the District of Maryland inquiring into FMCHs contractual arrangements with hospitals and physicians involving contracts relating to the management of in-patient acute dialysis services. On August 27, 2020, after the USAO declined to pursue the matter by intervening, the United States District Court for Maryland unsealed a 2014 relators qui tam complaint that gave rise to the investigation. United States ex rel. Martin Flanagan v. Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc., 2014 Civ. 00665 (D. Maryland). The relator has served the complaint and litigation is proceed- ing. In response to FMCHs motion to dismiss the unsealed complaint, the relator filed an amended complaint on February 5, 2021 making broad allegations about financial relationships between FMCH and nephrologists. In July 2015, the Attorney General for Hawaii issued a civil complaint under the Hawaii False Claims Act alleging a conspiracy pursuant to which certain Liberty Dialysis subsidiaries of FMCH overbilled Hawaii Medicaid for Libertys Epogen administrations to Hawaii Medicaid patients during the period from 2006 through 2010, prior to the time of FMCHs acquisition of Liberty. Hawaii v. Liberty DialysisHawaii, LLC et al., Case No. 15-1-1357-07 (Hawaii 1st Circuit). The State alleges that Liberty acted unlawfully by relying on incorrect and unauthorized billing guidance provided to Liberty by Xerox State Healthcare LLC, which acted as Hawaiis contracted adminis- trator for its Medicaid program reimbursement operations during the relevant period. With dis- covery concluded, the State has specified that its demands for relief relate to $7,700 (6,275) in overpayments on approximately twenty thousand claims submitted by Liberty. After prevailing on motions by Xerox to preclude it from doing so, FMCH is pursuing third-party claims for contri- bution and indemnification against Xerox. The States False Claims Act complaint was filed after Liberty initiated an administrative action challenging the States recoupment of alleged overpay- ments from sums currently owed to Liberty. The civil litigation and administrative action are pro- ceeding in parallel. Trial in the civil litigation has been postponed because of COVID-19-related administrative issues and has been rescheduled for January 2022. On August 31, 2015, FMCH received a subpoena under the False Claims Act from the United States Attorney for the District of Colorado (Denver) inquiring into FMCHs participation in and management of dialysis facility joint ventures in which physicians are partners. FMCH continues to cooperate in the Denver USAO investigation, which has come to focus on purchases and sales of minority interests in ongoing outpatient facilities between FMCH and physician groups. On November 25, 2015, FMCH received a subpoena under the False Claims Act from the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn) also inquiring into FMCHs involve- ment in certain dialysis facility joint ventures in New York. On September 26, 2018, the Brooklyn USAO declined to intervene on the qui tam complaint filed under seal in 2014 that gave rise to this investigation. CKD Project LLC v. Fresenius Medical Care, 2014 Civ. 06646 (E.D.N.Y. Novem- ber 12, 2014). The court unsealed the complaint, allowing the relator to serve and proceed on its own. The relatora special-purpose entity formed by law firms to pursue qui tam proceedings has served its complaint and litigation is proceeding. Beginning October 6, 2015, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn) has led an investigation, through subpoenas issued under the False Claims Act, of uti- lization and invoicing by FMCHs subsidiary Azura Vascular Care for a period beginning after FMCHs acquisition of American Access Care LLC (AAC) in October 2011. FMCH is cooperating in the Brooklyn USAO investigation. The Brooklyn USAO has indicated that its investigation is nationwide in scope and is focused on whether certain access procedures performed at Azura facilities were medically unnecessary and whether certain physician assistants employed by Azura exceeded their permissible scope of practice. Allegations against AAC arising in districts in Connecticut, Florida and Rhode Island relating to utilization and invoicing were settled in 2015. On June 30, 2016, FMCH received a subpoena from the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas (Dallas) seeking information under the False Claims Act about the use and management of pharmaceuticals including Velphoro. The investigation encompasses DaVita, Amgen, Sanofi, and other pharmaceutical manufacturers and includes inquiries into whether certain compensation transfers between manufacturers and pharmacy vendors constituted unlawful kickbacks. FMCH understands that this investigation is substantively independent of the $63,700 (53,778) settlement by DaVita Rx announced on December 14, 2017 in the mat- ter styled United States ex rel. Gallian v. DaVita Rx, 2016 Civ. 0943 (N.D. Tex.). FMCH believes that this investigation is no longer active as to FMCH and will cease reporting on it absent mate- rial developments. On November 18, 2016, FMCH received a subpoena under the False Claims Act from the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn) seeking documents and informa- tion relating to the operations of Shiel Medical Laboratory, Inc. (Shiel), which FMCH acquired in October 2013. In the course of cooperating in the investigation and preparing to respond to the subpoena, FMCH identified falsifications and misrepresentations in documents submitted by a Shiel salesperson that relate to the integrity of certain invoices submitted by Shiel for laboratory testing for patients in long-term care facilities. On February 21, 2017, FMCH terminated the employee and notified the United States Attorney of the termination and its circumstances. The terminated employees conduct is expected to result in demands for FMCH to refund over- payments and to pay related penalties under applicable laws, but the monetary value of such payment demands cannot yet be reasonably estimated. FMCH contends that, under the asset sale provisions of its 2013 Shiel acquisition, it is not responsible for misconduct by the terminated employee or other Shiel employees prior to the date of the acquisition. The Brooklyn USAO continues to investigate a range of issues involving Shiel, including allegations of improper com- pensation (kickbacks) to physicians, and has disclosed that multiple sealed qui tam complaints underlie the investigation. On December 12, 2017, FMCH sold to Quest Diagnostics certain Shiel operations that are the subject of this Brooklyn subpoena, including the misconduct reported to the United States Attorney. Under the Quest Diagnostics sale agreement, FMCH retains responsibility for respond- ing to the Brooklyn investigation and for liabilities arising from conduct occurring after its 2013 acquisition of Shiel and prior to its sale of Shiel to Quest Diagnostics. FMCH is cooperating in the investigation. On December 14, 2016, CMS, which administers the federal Medicare program, published an Interim Final Rule (IFR) titled Medicare Program; Conditions for Coverage for End-Stage Renal Disease Facilities-Third Party Payment. The IFR would have amended the Conditions for Cover- age for dialysis providers, like FMCH and would have effectively enabled insurers to reject pre- mium payments made by or on behalf of patients who received grants for individual market cov- erage from the American Kidney Fund (AKF or the Fund). The IFR could thus have resulted in those patients losing individual insurance market coverage. The loss of coverage for these patients would have had a material and adverse impact on the operating results of FMCH. On January 25, 2017, a federal district court in Texas responsible for litigation initiated by a patient advocacy group and dialysis providers including FMCH preliminarily enjoined CMS from implementing the IFR. Dialysis Patient Citizens v. Burwell, 2017 Civ. 0016 (E.D. Texas, Sherman Div.). The preliminary injunction was based on CMSs failure to follow appropriate notice-and- comment procedures in adopting the IFR. The injunction remains in place and the court retains jurisdiction over the dispute. On June 22, 2017, CMS requested a stay of proceedings in the litigation pending further rulemak- ing concerning the IFR. CMS stated, in support of its request, that it expects to publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register and otherwise pursue a notice-and-comment process. Plaintiffs in the litigation, including FMCH, consented to the stay, which was granted by the court on June 27, 2017. On January 3, 2017, FMCH received a subpoena from the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts under the False Claims Act inquiring into FMCHs interactions and relationships with the AKF, including FMCHs charitable contributions to the Fund and the Funds financial assistance to patients for insurance premiums. Thereafter, FMCH cooperated in the investigation, the USAO declined to intervene in the relators qui tam complaint that gave rise to the subpoena. On July 17, 2020, the relator filed a notice of dismissal without serving his complaint or otherwise pursuing his allegations and the court thereafter closed the case. On April 8, 2019, United Healthcare initiated arbitration against FMCH alleging that FMCH unlaw- fully steered patients by waiving co-payments and other means away from coverage under government-funded insurance plans including Medicare into United Healthcares commercial plans, including Affordable Care Act exchange plans. FMCH denied and contested Uniteds claims. On September 16, 2020, FMCH and United entered a settlement agreement requiring (1) certain amendments to contracts between United and FMCH governing terms and conditions for dialysis treatments to be performed by FMCH for United beneficiaries and (2) dismissal of the arbitra- tions with each party to bear its own costs and expenses. In consideration of the prolonged absence of federal government activity, changes in administra- tion, and resolution of the United Healthcare dispute, the Company believes that the previously reported matters involving charitable contributions do not present material risk. Accordingly, and absent new material developments, the Company will cease reporting on them. In early May 2017, the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee (Nashville) issued identical subpoenas to FMCH and two subsidiaries under the False Claims Act concerning FMCHs retail pharmaceutical business. The investigation is exploring allegations related to improper inducements to dialysis patients to fill oral prescriptions through FMCHs pharmacy service, improper billing for returned pharmacy products and other allegations similar to those underlying the $63,700 (53,778) settlement by DaVita Rx in Texas announced on December 14, 2017. United States ex rel. Gallian, 2016 Civ. 00943 (N.D. Tex.). FMCH is cooperating in the Nash- ville investigation. On March 12, 2018, Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd. and Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma France S.A.S. (collectively, VFMCRP) (See NOTe 5), filed a complaint for pat- ent infringement against Lupin Atlantis Holdings SA and Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc. (collectively, Lupin), and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (Case 1:18-cv-00390-MN). The patent infringement action is in response to Lupin and Tevas filings of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Admin- istration (FDA) for generic versions of Velphoro. Velphoro is protected by patents listed in the FDAs Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also known as the Orange Book. The complaint was filed within the 45-day period provided for under the Hatch- Waxman legislation, and triggered a stay of FDA approval of the ANDAs for 30 months (specifi- cally, up to July 29, 2020 for Lupins ANDA; and August 6, 2020 for Tevas ANDA. In response to another ANDA being filed for a generic Velphoro, VFMCRP filed a complaint for patent infringe- ment against Annora Pharma Private Ltd., and Hetero Labs Ltd. (collectively, Annora), in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on December 17, 2018. The case was settled among the parties, thus terminating the court action on August 4, 2020. On May 26, 2020, VFMCRP filed a further complaint for patent infringement against Lupin in the U.S. District Court for the Dis- trict of Delaware (Case No. 1:20-cv-00697-MN) in response to Lupins ANDA for a generic version of Velphoro and on the basis of a newly listed patent in the Orange Book. On July 6, 2020, VFMCRP filed an additional complaint for patent infringement against Lupin and Teva in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (Case No. 1:20-cv-00911-MN) in response to the compa- nies ANDA for generic versions of Velphoro and on the basis of two newly listed patents in the Orange Book. All cases involving Lupin as defendant were settled among the parties, thus termi- nating the corresponding court actions on December 18, 2020. On December 17, 2018, FMCH was served with a subpoena under the False Claims Act from the United States Attorney for the District of Colorado (Denver) as part of an investigation of allega- tions against DaVita, Inc. involving transactions between FMCH and DaVita. The subject transac- tions include sales and purchases of dialysis facilities, dialysis-related products and pharmaceu- ticals, including dialysis machines and dialyzers, and contracts for certain administrative services. FMCH is cooperating in the investigation. On June 28, 2019, certain FMCH subsidiaries filed a complaint against the United States seeking to recover monies owed to them by the United States Department of Defense under the Tricare program, and to preclude Tricare from recouping monies previously paid. Bio-Medical Applica- tions of Georgia, Inc., et al. v. United States, CA 19-947, United States Court of Federal Claims. Tri- care provides reimbursement for dialysis treatments and other medical care provided to mem- bers of the military services, their dependents and retirees. The litigation challenges unpublished administrative actions by Tricare administrators reducing the rate of compensation paid for dial- ysis treatments provided to Tricare beneficiaries based on a recasting or crosswalking of codes used and followed in invoicing without objection for many years. Tricare administrators have acknowledged the unpublished administrative action and declined to change or abandon it. On July 8, 2020, the U.S. government filed its answer (and confirmed their position). The parties will proceed to discovery. The court has not yet set a date for trial in this matter. FMCH has imposed a constraint on revenue otherwise recognized from the Tricare program that it believes, in con- sideration of facts currently known, sufficient to account for the risk of this litigation. On May 22, 2020, CMS issued a final rule that, effective January 1, 2021, removes outpatient dial- ysis facilities from the time-and-distance standards applicable under the network adequacy rules for Medicare Advantage plans. On June 22, 2020, Dialysis Patient Citizens, a charitable patient advocacy organization, filed a lawsuit on behalf of all dialysis patients to challenge that rule, and on July 13, 2020, FMCH along with two other dialysis providers joined the lawsuit. Dialysis Patient Citizens, et al. v. Alex Azar, et al., U.S.D.C. D.C, 1:20-cv-01664. The plaintiffs sought to have the final rule regarding outpatient dialysis facilities vacated and to enjoin CMS from enforcing those provisions. On January 19, 2021, the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the case without prejudice. On August 21, 2020, FMCH was served with a subpoena from the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts requesting information and documents related to urgent care centers that FMCH owned, operated, or controlled as part of its ChoiceOne and Medspring urgent care operations prior to its divestiture of and exit from that line of business in 2018. The subpoena appears to be related to an ongoing investigation of alleged upcoding in the urgent care industry, which has resulted in certain published settlements under the federal False Claims Act. FMCH is cooperating in the investigation. From time to time, the Company is a party to or may be threatened with other litigation or arbi- tration, claims or assessments arising in the ordinary course of its business. Management regu- larly analyzes current information including, as applicable, the Companys defenses and insur- ance coverage and, as necessary, provides accruals for probable liabilities for the eventual disposition of these matters. The Company, like other health care providers, insurance plans and suppliers, conducts its oper- ations under intense government regulation and scrutiny. It must comply with regulations which relate to or govern the safety and efficacy of medical products and supplies, the marketing and distribution of such products, the operation of manufacturing facilities, laboratories, dialysis clin- ics and other health care facilities, and environmental and occupational health and safety. With respect to its development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of medical products, if such compliance is not maintained, the Company could be subject to significant adverse regulatory actions by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities outside the U.S. These regulatory actions could include warning letters or other enforcement notices from the FDA, and / or com- parable foreign regulatory authority which may require the Company to expend significant time and resources in order to implement appropriate corrective actions. If the Company does not address matters raised in warning letters or other enforcement notices to the satisfaction of the FDA and / or comparable regulatory authorities outside the U.S., these regulatory authorities could take additional actions, including product recalls, injunctions against the distribution of products or operation of manufacturing plants, civil penalties, seizures of the Companys prod- ucts and / or criminal prosecution. FMCH is currently engaged in remediation efforts with respect to one pending FDA warning letter. The Company must also comply with the laws of the United States, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the federal Stark Law, the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law and the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as other federal and state fraud and abuse laws. Applicable laws or regulations may be amended, or enforcement agencies or courts may make interpretations that differ from the Com- panys interpretations or the manner in which it conducts its business. Enforcement has become a high priority for the federal government and some states. In addition, the provisions of the False Claims Act authorizing payment of a portion of any recovery to the party bringing the suit encourage private plaintiffs to commence whistleblower actions. By virtue of this regulatory environment, the Companys business activities and practices are subject to extensive review by regulatory authorities and private parties, and continuing audits, subpoenas, other inquiries, claims and litigation relating to the Companys compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Company may not always be aware that an inquiry or action has begun, particularly in the case of whistleblower actions, which are initially filed under court seal. The Company operates many facilities and handles the personal data (PD) of its patients and ben- eficiaries throughout the United States and other parts of the world and engages with other busi- ness associates to help it carry out its health care activities. In such a decentralized system, it is often difficult to maintain the desired level of oversight and control over the thousands of indi- viduals employed by many affiliated companies and its business associates. On occasion, the Company or its business associates may experience a breach under the Health Insurance Porta- bility and Accountability Act Privacy Rule and Security Rules, the EUs General Data Protection Regulation and or other similar laws (Data Protection Laws) when there has been impermissible use, access, or disclosure of unsecured PD or when the Company or its business associates neglect to implement the required administrative, technical and physical safeguards of its elec- tronic systems and devices, or a data breach that results in impermissible use, access or disclo- sure of personal identifying information of its employees, patients and beneficiaries. On those occasions, the Company must comply with applicable breach notification requirements. The Company relies upon its management structure, regulatory and legal resources, and the effective operation of its compliance program to direct, manage and monitor the activities of its employees. On occasion, the Company may identify instances where employees or other agents deliberately, recklessly or inadvertently contravene the Companys policies or violate applicable law. The actions of such persons may subject the Company and its subsidiaries to liability under the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law, the False Claims Act, Data Protection Laws, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, among other laws and comparable state laws or laws of other countries. Physicians, hospitals and other participants in the health care industry are also subject to a large number of lawsuits alleging professional negligence, malpractice, product liability, workers com- pensation or related claims, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs. The Company has been and is currently subject to these suits due to the nature of its business and expects that those types of lawsuits may continue. Although the Company maintains insur- ance at a level which it believes to be prudent, it cannot assure that the coverage limits will be adequate or that insurance will cover all asserted claims. A successful claim against the Company or any of its subsidiaries in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect upon it and the results of its operations. Any claims, regardless of their merit or eventual out- come, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys reputation and business. The Company has also had claims asserted against it and has had lawsuits filed against it relating to alleged patent infringements or businesses that it has acquired or divested. These claims and suits relate both to operation of the businesses and to the acquisition and divestiture transac- tions. The Company has, when appropriate, asserted its own claims, and claims for indemnifica- tion. A successful claim against the Company or any of its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect upon its business, financial condition, and the results of its operations. Any claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, could have a material adverse effect on the Com- panys reputation and business. In Germany, the tax audits for the years 2006 through 2009 have been substantially completed. The German tax authorities have indicated a re-qualification of dividends received in connection with intercompany mandatorily redeemable preferred shares into fully taxable interest payments for these and subsequent years until 2013. The Company has defended its position and will avail itself of appropriate remedies. The Company is also subject to ongoing and future tax audits in the U.S., Germany and other jurisdictions in the ordinary course of business. Tax authorities rou- tinely pursue adjustments to the Companys tax returns and disallowances of claimed tax deduc- tions. When appropriate, the Company defends these adjustments and disallowances and asserts its own claims. A successful tax related claim against the Company or any of its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect upon its business, financial condition and results of operations. Other than those individual contingent liabilities mentioned above, the current estimated amount of the Companys other known individual contingent liabilities is immaterial. For further informa- tion regarding the Companys purchase commitments, See NOTe 8 aND NOTe 10. 23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TaBLeS 5.74 STaRTINg ON page 223 aND 5.75 STaRTINg ON page 224 show the carrying amounts and fair values of the Companys financial instruments at December 31, 2020 and Decem- ber 31, 2019. Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are categorized in the following three-tier fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs in making the measurements. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 is defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are directly or indirectly observable. Level 3 is defined as unobserv- able inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. Fair value information is not provided for financial instruments, if the car- rying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to the relatively short period of maturity of these instruments. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy have not occurred as of December 31, 2020. The Company accounts for transfers at the end of the reporting period. At September 30, 2019 the Company transferred its Humacyte investment with a carrying amount of 186,427 from Level 2 to Level 3, because the Company remeasured the fair value using a dis- counted cash flow model after events or changes in circumstances were identified that had a sig- nificant effect on the fair value of the investment. Non-derivative financial instruments The significant methods and assumptions used for the classification and measurement of non-de- rivative financial instruments are as follows: The Company assessed its business models and the cash flow characteristics of its financial assets. The vast majority of the non-derivative financial assets are held in order to collect the contractual cash flows. The contractual terms of the financial assets allow the conclusion that the cash flows represent payment of principle and interest only. Trade accounts and other receiv- ables from unrelated parties, Accounts receivable from related parties and Other financial assets are consequently measured at amortized cost. Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash funds and other short-term investments. Cash funds are measured at amortized cost. Short-term investments are highly liquid and readily con- vertible to known amounts of cash. Short-term investments are measured at FVPL. The risk of changes in fair value is insignificant.

Cash and cash equivalents measured at amortized cost is not categorized. Equity investments are not held for trading. At initial recognition the Company elected, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, to represent subsequent changes in the fair value of individual strategic investments in OCI. All equity investments for which changes in fair value are recorded in OCI relate to purchases of publicly traded shares or percentage ownership of companies in the health sciences or adjacent fields and are made up of individually non-significant investments. At December 31, 2020, the Company held 12 non-listed equity investments (December 31, 2019: 12) and 1 listed equity investment (December 31, 2019: 1). During 2020, gains of 11,385 were trans- ferred from OCI to retained earnings as one investment was disposed of and another was fully consolidated during the year. There were no dividends recognized during 2020 and 2019 from these equity investments. If equity investments are quoted in an active market, the fair value is based on price quotations at the period-end-date. From time to time the Company engages exter- nal valuation firms to determine the fair value of Level 3 equity investments. The external valua- tion uses a discounted cash flow model, which includes significant unobservable inputs such as investment specific forecasted financial statements, weighted average cost of capital, that reflects current market assessments as well as a terminal growth rate. The Companys listed and non-listed equity investments measured at FVOCI had the fair values shown in TaBLe 5.76 at December 31, 2020 and 2019. T 5.76 EQUITY INVESTMENTS MEASURED AT FVOCI IN  THOUS 2020 2019 Listed equity investments 11,911 13,110 Non-listed equity investments 45,000 37,865 Equity investments FVOCI 56,911 50,975 The majority of the debt securities are held within a business model whose objective is achieving both contractual cash flows and sell the securities. The standard coupon bonds give rise on spec- ified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal amount. Subsequently these financial assets have been classified as FVOCI. The smaller part of debt securities does not give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principle and interest. Consequently, these securities are measured at FVPL. In general, most of the debt secu- rities are quoted in an active market. Long-term debt is initially recognized at its fair value. The fair values of major long-term debt are calculated on the basis of market information. Liabilities for which market quotes are available are measured using these quotes. The fair values of the other long-term debt are calculated at the present value of the respective future cash flows. To determine these present values, the pre- vailing interest rates and credit spreads for the Company as of the balance sheet date are used. Variable payments outstanding for acquisitions are recognized at their fair value. The estimation of the individual fair values is based on the key inputs of the arrangement that determine the future contingent payment as well as the Companys expectation of these factors. The Company assesses the likelihood and timing of achieving the relevant objectives. The underlying assump- tions are reviewed regularly. Put option liabilities are recognized at the present value of the exercise price of the option. The exercise price of the option is generally based on fair value. The methodology the Company uses to estimate the fair values assumes the greater of net book value or a multiple of earnings, based on historical earnings, development stage of the underlying business and other factors. From time to time the Company engages external valuation firms for the valuation of the put options. The external valuation estimates the fair values using a combination of discounted cash flows and a multiple of earnings and / or revenue. The put option liabilities are discounted at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The estimated fair values of these put options can also fluctuate, and the discounted cash flows as well as the implicit multiple of earnings and / or revenue at which these obligations may ultimately be settled could vary significantly from the Companys current esti- mates depending upon market conditions. For the purpose of analyzing the impact of changes in unobservable inputs on the fair value measurement of put option liabilities, the Company assumes an increase on earnings of 10 % compared to the actual estimation as of the balance sheet date. The corresponding increase in fair value of 63,362 is then compared to the total lia- bilities and the shareholders equity of the Company. This analysis shows that an increase of 10 % in the relevant earnings would have an effect of less than 1 % on the total liabilities and less than 1 % on the shareholders equity of the Company. At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the Companys potential obligations under these put option liabilities, which are recorded in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities, were 882,422, 934,425 and 818,871, respectively. At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, put option liabilities with an aggregate purchase obligation of 395,759, 385,924 and 408,525, respec- tively, were exercisable. In the last three fiscal years ending December 31, 2020, 231 such put options have been exercised for a total consideration of 98,936.

TaBLe 5.77 is a roll forward of Level 3 financial instruments at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial risks The Company is exposed to effects related to foreign exchange fluctuations in connection with its international business activities that are denominated in various currencies. In order to finance its business operations, the Company issues bonds and enters mainly into long-term credit agree- ments with banks. Due to these financing activities, the Company is exposed to changes in the interest rate as well as to price risks of balance sheet items with a fixed interest rate. In order to manage the risk of currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the Com- pany enters into various hedging transactions by means of derivative instruments with highly rated financial institutions (generally investment grade) as authorized by the Companys General Partner. On a quarterly basis, the Company performs an assessment of its counterparty credit risk. The Company currently considers this risk to be low (as the counterparties are generally investment grade). The Companys policy, which has been consistently followed, is that financial derivatives be used only for the purpose of hedging foreign currency and interest rate exposure. In certain instances, the Company enters into derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting but are utilized for economic purposes (economic hedges). The Company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company established guidelines for risk assessment procedures and controls for the use of financial instruments. They include a clear segregation of duties with regard to execution on one side and administration, accounting and controlling on the other. To reduce the credit risk arising from derivatives the Company entered into Master Netting Agreements with banks. Through such agreements, positive and negative fair values of the deriv- ative contracts could be offset against one another if a partner becomes insolvent. This offset- ting is valid for transactions where the aggregate amount of obligations owed to and receivable from are not equal. If insolvency occurs, the party which owes the larger amount is obliged to pay the other party the difference between the amounts owed in the form of one net payment. These master netting agreements do not provide a basis for offsetting the fair values of deriva- tive financial instruments in the statement of financial position as the offsetting criteria under IFRS are not satisfied. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had 6,452 and 2,108 of derivative financial assets subject to netting arrangements and 40,724 and 12,355 of derivative financial liabilities subject to netting arrangements. Offsetting these derivative financial instruments would have resulted in net assets of 1,192 and 137 as well as net liabilities of 35,464 and 10,384 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The Company calculates benchmarks for individual exposures in order to quantify interest and for- eign exchange risks. The benchmarks are derived from achievable and reasonable market rates. Depending on the individual benchmarks, hedging strategies are agreed on and implemented. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Bonds in September 2014, the Company pur- chased Share Options. Any change in the Companys share price above the conversion price would be offset by a corresponding value change in the Share Options. The Share Options expired in November 2019. Market risk Foreign exchange risk management The Company conducts business on a global basis in various currencies, though a majority of its operations are in Germany and the United States. For financial reporting purposes, the Company reports in euro pursuant to Section 315e and Section 244 HGB. Therefore, changes in the rate of exchange between the euro and the local currencies in which the financial statements of the The notional amounts of foreign exchange contracts in place that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges totaled 134,637 and 115,263 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the Company had foreign exchange derivatives with matur- ities of up to 14 months. Earnings of the Company were not materially affected by hedge ineffec- tiveness in the reporting period since the critical terms of the interest and foreign exchange derivatives matched mainly the critical terms of the underlying exposures. The Company also enters into derivative contracts for forecasted product purchases and sales and for intercompany loans in foreign currencies which do not qualify for hedge accounting but are utilized for economic hedges as defined above. The notional amounts of economic hedges totaled 1,537,416 and 626,585 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The Company uses a Cash-Flow-at-Risk (CFaR) model in order to estimate and quantify transac- tion risks from foreign currencies. The basis for the analysis of the currency risks are the foreign currency cash flows that are reasonably expected to arise within the following twelve months, less any hedges. Under the CFaR approach, the potential currency fluctuations of these net expo- sures are shown as probability distributions based on historical volatilities and correlations of the preceding 250 business days. The calculation is made assuming a confidence level of 95 % and a holding period of up to one year. The aggregation of currency risks has risk-mitigating effects due to correlations between the transactions concerned, i.e. the overall portfolios risk exposure is generally less than the sum total of the underlying individual risks. Based on a net exposure of 1,565,589, the Companys CFaR amounts to 59,557 at December 31, 2020, this means with a probability of 95 % a potential loss in relation to the forecasted foreign exchange cash flows of the next twelve months will be not higher than 59,557. TaBLe 5.78 shows the average hedging rate and the nominal amount of the foreign exchange for- ward contracts for the currencies with highest hedging volume at December 31, 2020. Companys international operations are maintained, affect its results of operations and financial position as reported in its consolidated financial statements. Additionally, individual subsidiaries are exposed to transactional risks mainly resulting from T 5.78 SIGNIFICANT CURRENCY PAIRS IN  THOUS intercompany purchases between production sites and other subsidiaries with different func- Nominal amount Average hedging rate tional currencies. This exposes the subsidiaries to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between EUR / USD 988,595 1.1902 the invoicing currencies and the currency in which their local operations are conducted.

Interest rate risk management The Companys interest rate risks mainly arise from money market and capital market trans- actions of the group for financing its business activities. For purposes of analyzing the impact of changes in the relevant reference interest rates on the Companys results of operations, the Company calculates the portion of financial debt which bears variable interest rate and which has not been hedged by means of interest rate swaps or options against rising interest rates. For this particular part of its liabilities, the Company assumes an increase in the Reference Rates of 0.5 % compared to the actual rates as of the balance sheet date. The corresponding additional annual interest expense is then compared to the Companys net income. This analysis shows that an increase of 0.5 % in the relevant Reference Rates would contract as of the balance sheet date. The result is then discounted on the basis of the market interest rates prevailing at the balance sheet date for the applicable currency. The Companys own credit risk is incorporated in the fair value estimation of derivatives that are liabilities. Counterparty credit risk adjustments are factored into the valuation of derivatives that are assets. The Company monitors and analyses the credit risk from derivative financial instru- ments on a regular basis. For the valuation of derivative financial instruments, the credit risk is considered in the fair value of every individual instrument. The default probability is based upon the credit default swap spreads of each counterparty appropriate for the duration. The calcula- tion of the credit risk considered in the valuation is performed by multiplying the default proba- bility appropriate for the duration with the expected discounted cash flows of the derivative financial instrument. have an effect of less than 1 % on the consolidated net income and less than 0.1 % on the share- holders equity of the Company. In addition, the Company also entered into interest rate hedges (pre-hedges) in anticipation of future long-term debt issuance. These pre-hedges are used to hedge interest rate exposures with regard to interest rates which are relevant for the future long-term debt issuance and which could rise until the respective debt is actually issued. These pre-hedges were settled at the issu- ance date of the corresponding long-term debt with the settlement amount recorded in AOCI amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had 7,572 and 9,249, respectively, related to settlements of pre-hedges deferred in AOCI, net of tax. Derivative financial instruments valuation TaBLe 5.79 shows the carrying amounts of the Companys derivatives at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of derivative finan- cial instruments are as follows: The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting the future cash flows on the basis of the market interest rates applicable for the remaining term of the contract as of the balance sheet date. To determine the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, the contracted forward rate is compared to the current forward rate for the remaining term of the T 5.79 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS VALUATION IN  THOUS 2020 2019 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Current Foreign exchange contracts 1,103 (1,642) 107 (2,484) Non-current Foreign exchange contracts 27 (25)  (50) DERIVATIVES IN CASH FLOW HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS 1,130 (1,667) 107 (2,534) Current Foreign exchange contracts 5,367 (39,281) 2,406 (10,762) Non-current Foreign exchange contracts     DERIVATES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS 5,367 (39,281) 2,406 (10,762) The effect of financial instruments on the consolidated statements of income The effects of financial instruments recorded in the consolidated statements of income consist of interest income of 41,137 (2019: 59,448), interest expense of 407,065 (2019: 486,039) as well as expected credit losses of 28,302 (2019: 42,315). In the fiscal year 2020 net losses from foreign currency transactions amount to 15,919 (2019: net losses 4,901).

TaBLe 5.81 ON page 230 shows the effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated financial statements. TaBLe 5.82 ON page 230 shows when the cash flow from derivative financial instruments is expected to occur. Credit risk The Company is exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties. With respect to derivative financial instruments it is not expected that any counterparty fails to meet its obligations as the counterparties are highly rated financial institutions (generally invest- ment grade). The maximum credit exposure of derivatives is represented by the fair value of those contracts with a positive fair value at the balance sheet date. The maximum credit expo- sure of all derivatives amounted to 6,497 at December 31, 2020 (2019: 2,513). The maximum credit risk resulting from the use of non-derivative financial instruments is defined as the total amount of all financial assets. In order to control this credit risk, the Companys management carries out an aging analysis of trade accounts and other receivables from unrelated parties. For details on the aging analysis and on expected credit losses, please See NOTe 7.

SEGMENT AND CORPORATE INFORMATION The Companys operating segments are the North America Segment, the EMEA Segment, the Asia-Pacific Segment and the Latin America Segment. The operating segments are determined based upon how the Company manages its businesses with geographical responsibilities. All seg- ments are primarily engaged in providing health care services and the distribution of products and equipment for the treatment of ESRD and other extracorporeal therapies. Management evaluates each segment using measures that reflect all of the segments control- lable revenues and expenses. With respect to the performance of business operations, manage- ment believes that the most appropriate measures are revenue, operating income and operat- ing income margin. The Company does not include income taxes as it believes taxes are outside the segments control. Financing is a corporate function, which the Companys segments do not control. Therefore, the Company does not include interest expense relating to financing as a segment measurement. Similarly, the Company does not allocate certain costs, which relate pri- marily to certain headquarters overhead charges, including accounting and finance as well as certain legal costs, because the Company believes that these costs are also not within the con- trol of the individual segments. Production of products, production asset management, quality and supply chain management as well as procurement related to production are centrally man- aged.

KGaA, Hof an der Saale REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT Audit Opinions We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA, Hof an der Saale, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2020, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of income, consolidated statement of shareholders equity and consolidated state- ment of cash flows for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2020, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2020. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the statement on corporate governance pursuant to  [Article] 289f HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and  315d HGB. Notes to the consolidated statements Supervisory Board and Management Board Independent Auditors Report In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,  the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pur- suant to  315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 Decem- ber 2020, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 Decem- ber 2020, and  the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Groups position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appro- priately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the group management report does not cover the content of the statement on corporate gover- nance referred to above. Pursuant to  322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any res- ervations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report. Basis for the Audit Opinions We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with  317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to sub- sequently as EU Audit Regulation) in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprufer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report section of our auditors report. We are inde- pendent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsi- bilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohib- ited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consoli- dated financial statements and on the group management report. Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2020. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters. In our view, the matter of most significance in our audit was as follows:  Recoverability of goodwill Our presentation of this key audit matter has been structured as follows: 1. Matter and issue 2. Audit approach and findings 3. Reference to further information Hereinafter we present the key audit matter: Recoverability of goodwill 1. In the Companys consolidated financial statements goodwill amounting in total to  12,959 million (40.9 % of total assets or 105.1 % of equity) is reported under the Goodwill balance sheet item. In accordance with IAS 36, the Company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill at least once a year for each group of cash generating units (CGUs) or more fre- quently if the Company becomes aware of events that occur or if circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. To perform the annual impairment test of goodwill, the Company identified its groups of cash generating units and determined their carrying value by assigning the operating assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those groups of CGUs. Groups of CGUs reflect the lowest level on which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. To comply with IFRS to determine possible impairments of these assets, the value in use of the groups of CGUs is first compared to the CGUs carrying amount. In cases where the value in use of the group of CGU is less than its carrying amount and the fair value less cost of disposal is not estimated to be higher than the value in use, the difference is recorded as an impairment of the carry- Notes to the consolidated statements Supervisory Board and Management Board Independent Auditors Report ing amount of the group of CGUs. The value in use of each group of CGUs is determined using estimated future cash flows for the unit discounted by a pre-tax discount rate (WACC) spe- cific to that group of CGUs. The annual impairment tests determined that it was necessary to recognize an impairment loss amounting to  194 million with respect to the group of CGUs Latin America. The outcome of this valuation is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the future cash inflows from the respective group of CGUs, the pre-tax discount rate used and other assumptions, and is, also against the back- ground of the effects of the ongoing Corona pandemic, subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the complex nature of the valuation, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit. 2. As part of our procedures on the goodwill impairment tests, we assessed the effectiveness of the processes and controls established by the Company with respect to the valuation model and the determination of the applicable pre-tax discount rate. Our procedures also included, among others, comparing the Companys historical financial forecasted budgets with the actual results, agreeing future cash flows to approved budgets, and performing sensitivity analyses over significant assumptions used by the executive directors, including the applied pre-tax discount rate. In addition, we involved our valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the pre-tax discount rates for each group of CGUs and the appropriateness of the valuation model. For groups of CGUs in which the value in use did not exceed the carrying amount significantly, we also performed procedures to assess the revenue growth rates, residual value growth rates and operating income margins used in the cash flow forecasts by comparing the development of assumptions to underlying documentation, including patient growth expectations. We also performed sensitivity analy- ses over the revenue growth rates, residual value growth rates, and operating income margin to evaluate the impact of changes to the respective group of CGUs value in use. Overall, the valuation parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable. 3. The Companys disclosures on goodwill are contained in NOTeS 1g), 2a) aND 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Other Information The executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information com- prises the statement on corporate governance pursuant to  289f HGB and  315d HGB, which we obtained prior to the date of our auditors report. The other information comprises further the separate non-financial group report pursuant to  315b Abs. 3 HGB, which we obtained prior to the date of our auditors report. The annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of the auditors report. Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information  is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group manage- ment report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated. Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial state- ments that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to  315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the exec- utive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstate- ment, whether due to fraud or error. Notes to the consolidated statements Supervisory Board and Management Board Independent Auditors Report In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Groups ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group manage- ment report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Groups position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future develop- ment. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to pro- vide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report. The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Groups financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report. Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Groups position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropri- ately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditors report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with  317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Gen- erally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprufer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial state- ments and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and per- form audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of inter- nal controls.  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circums- tances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.  Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Groups ability to con- tinue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditors report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtai- ned up to the date of our auditors report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial state- ments, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial state- ments give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial per- formance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to  315e Abs. 1 HGB.  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the ent- ities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direc- tion, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions. Notes to the consolidated statements Supervisory Board and Management Board Independent Auditors Report  Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Groups position it provides.  Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive direc- tors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the pro- spective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoi- dable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those mat- ters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our audi- tors report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.

The level of this protein provides information about a patients general nutritional condition. AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPT (ADR) A certificate issued by an American depositary bank allowing U.S. investors to have an indirect stake in a non-U.S. company (rather than holding actual shares). Fresenius Medical Care shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADR). ANEMIA Reduced ability of the blood to transport oxygen, measured as a lower hemoglobin concentration in the blood. ANTICOAGULANT An agent (e.g. heparin) that prevents blood coagulation. AUTOMATED PERITONEAL DIALYSIS (APD) Machine-supported version of peritoneal dialysis treatment that is usually performed at night. B BIOFINE Environmentally friendly material for producing foils, tubing and other components for peritoneal dialysis and acute dialysis ( kidney failure, acute). Biofine is recyclable and PVC-free. BLOOD Fluid circulating in the body consisting of blood plasma and blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, etc.). The main function of blood is to transport oxygen, nutrients and hormones to the bodys cells and to remove waste products (such as carbon dioxide and urea). Blood also regulates the water and electrolyte balance and helps ward off contaminants as part of the immune system. BLOOD CELLS, RED  ERYTHROCYTES Blood cells that are responsible for transporting oxygen. They are produced by erythropoietin, a hormone formed in the kid- neys. BLOOD CELLS, WHITE  LEUKOCYTES Blood cells that are responsible for defending the human body against infections. They are involved in allergic reactions and destroy damaged, old or dead cells in the body. BLOOD COAGULATION A complex process in which solid clots are formed that stem the flow of blood. The damaged wall of a blood vessel is cov- ered by a fibrin clot that stops hemorrhaging and helps repair the damaged vessel. Coagulation disorders can lead to increased hemorrhaging and / or thrombosis, and even embo- lism. During dialysis treatment, blood coagulation is inhibited by administering anticoagulants (such as heparin). BLOODLINE SYSTEM Tubing system connecting a patients blood circulation to a dialyzer during dialysis treatment. C CALCIMIMETICS Drugs that have a positive effect on the bone and mineral metabolism, which is often disturbed in chronically ill kidney patients. Calcimimetics supplement treatment of chronic kid- ney failure ( kidney failure, chronic). CATHETER A flexible tube inserted surgically through the skin into a blood vessel or a body cavity to transport fluid into or out of the body. In peritoneal dialysis, a catheter is used to infuse dialy- sate into the abdominal cavity and drain it out again. In hemodialysis, a catheter can be used as a vascular access for dialysis treatment. In this case, it is usually inserted into the superior vena cava, or occasionally the femoral vein. CONTINUOUS AMBULATORY PERITONEAL DIALYSIS (CAPD) A treatment method in which the dialysate is exchanged manually, generally four times a day. CSR DIRECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION ACT A law that became effective in April 2017 to change the German Commercial Code with the aim of strengthening non-financial reporting by certain major capital market companies in their (group) management reports. CYCLER A device that automatically exchanges the dialysis solution that flows through the peritoneum and removes excess water and harmful substances from the patients body over a period of several hours, typically at night. D DAX The German stock index, calculated on the basis of the weighted prices of the 30 largest German companies listed on the stock exchange in terms of market capitalization and trading volume. DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING (DSO) A ratio indicating the average number of days it takes for a receivable to be paid. A shorter DSO results in lower interest charges for the creditor and a lower risk of default. DEBT / EBITDA RATIO An important indicator in corporate management. It is calculated by putting a companys debt in relation to its earn- ings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA) and other non-cash charges. DELIVERED OPERATING INCOME Operating income less noncontrolling interests. We consider delivered operating income to be an important indicator for investors because of the significance of noncontrolling inter- ests in our operating activities. Delivered operating income is roughly equivalent to the operating income attributable to the shareholders of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA. DIABETES An increased blood sugar level resulting from the bodys inabil- ity to regulate glucose efficiently in the bodys cells. Insulin, the main regulatory hormone in sugar metabolism, usually helps in this process. DIALYSATE Dialysis solution  a fluid used in dialysis to remove the sub- stances filtered out during treatment and excess water from the blood. DIALYSIS A form of renal replacement therapy where a semi-permeable membrane  the patients peritoneum in peritoneal dialysis or the membrane of the dialyzer in hemodialysis  is used to clean a patients blood. DIALYSIS SOLUTION Dialysate DIALYZER A special filter used in hemodialysis to remove toxic sub- stances, waste products of metabolic processes, and excess water from the blood. The dialyzer is frequently referred to as an artificial kidney. DIVIDEND A portion of a companys profit. The profit to be distributed is divided by the number of outstanding shares to produce the dividend per share, which is paid to shareholders usually once a year in the form of cash. E EBITDA (EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) A financial ratio to describe a companys operating perfor- mance before capital expenditure. EMERGING MARKETS Term for countries that have grown increasingly in recent years and whose economic markets are on the way to becoming developed. ERYTHROPOIESIS-STIMULATING AGENTS (ESA) Recombinant (artificially produced) human EPO that is commonly prescribed to patients on dialysis who suffer from anemia. F FDA U.S. Food and Drug Administration. FREE FLOAT The total number of shares of a stock corporation that are available for trading. According to the definition by Deutsche Borse, the free float includes all shares that are not held by major shareholders (with more than 5 % of the registered share capital), and can therefore be acquired and traded by the general public. G GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE (GRI) The Global Reporting Initiative has defined guidelines for sus- tainability reporting. Companies as well as governments and non-governmental organizations worldwide report on their economic, environmental and social strategy based on these data and indicators. GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE (GFR) Indicates the volume of liquid filtered by the kidneys from the blood per minute (primary urine). If the GFR is less than 15 ml / min (stage 5), dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed. Patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (GFR of 15 to 29 ml / min) have advanced kidney damage; it is highly likely that these patients will need dialysis or a kidney transplant in the near future. Stages of chronic kidney disease according to the U.S. National Kidney Foundation:  Stage 1  kidney damage with normal or increased GFR  90 GFR (ml / min)  Stage 2  kidney damage with slightly decreased GFR 60  89 GFR (ml / min)  Stage 3  kidney damage with moderately decreased GFR 30  59 GFR (ml / min)  Stage 4  kidney damage with greatly decreased GFR 15  29 GFR (ml / min)  Stage 5  kidney failure (or dialysis) < 15 GFR (ml / min) H HEMODIAFILTRATION (HDF) A process combining hemodialysis and hemofiltration. The theoretical basis for the combination of both methods is the fact that low-molecular substances such as urea and creat- inine are predominantly removed by diffusive transportation as in hemodialysis, whereas larger molecules are mainly removed by convective transportation as in hemofiltration. In hemodi- afiltration (HDF), the total amount of toxins removed is greater than in the individual processes, since convection and diffusion are not cumulative, but run in parallel and influence each other. HDF uses synthetic membranes that are more permeable (high- flux dialyzers) and have a better ultrafiltration performance. HEMODIALYSIS (HD) A treatment method for dialysis patients in which the patients blood flows through plastic bloodlines into a special filter, the dialyzer. In the dialyzer, waste products from metabolic pro- cesses and excess water are removed from the blood and trans- ported away in the dialysate. Afterwards, the purified blood is returned to the patients body. The process is controlled by a hemodialysis machine that pumps blood, adds anti-coagulants, regulates the purification process, and controls the mixing of the dialysate and its flow rate through the system. A patient typically receives three treatments per week, each lasting between three and six hours. Blood pump Anticoagulant HEMOFILTRATION (HF) A form of treatment for patients with chronic kidney failure ( kidney failure, chronic) that does not use dialysate. The solutes are removed by filtering the plasma water through a semi-permeable membrane by means of convective forces. A substitution fluid is infused to replace the volume removed by filtration. HEMOGLOBIN Component of red blood cells that binds oxygen and carries it through the body. It also gives blood its color (blood pigment). HEPARIN Universal anticoagulant substance administered during hemodialysis to slow down blood coagulation. I IFRS (INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS) Accounting standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). ISO International Organization for Standardization. K KIDNEY FAILURE, ACUTE Used dialysate Fresh dialysate Blood from the patient Dialyzer (filter) Blood to the patient HIGHVOLUMEHDF A form of hemodiafiltration (HDF). With HighVolumeHDF, the volume of fluid substituted by convective transport is greater than with HDF. Recent studies show that HighVolume- HDF significantly increases patient survival rates compared to conventional dialysis treatment methods. HOME DIALYSIS Form of dialysis performed at home after completing profes- sional training. In principle, peritoneal dialysis as well as hemodialysis (as home hemodialysis) can be performed at home. Acute loss of renal function. Depending on the severity of renal function loss, dialysis treatment may be necessary temporarily. Unlike chronic kidney failure kidney failure, chronic, dial- ysis can help to completely restore kidney function in many patients with acute kidney failure. KIDNEY FAILURE, CHRONIC (END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD) Permanent failure of the kidney (terminal kidney failure) resulting from a slow and progressive loss of kidney function (no more detoxification of the body) over several years. Since the renal function cannot be recovered, patients must be treated with renal replacement therapy, i.e. a kidney transplan- tation or dialysis. Chronic kidney failure is accompanied by long-term complications such as renal anemia, hypertension and other cardiovascular problems, as well as bone disease, loss of appetite and malnutrition. KIDNEYS Two vital organs located at the rear of the abdominal cavity, one each on the right and left side of the spinal column. They are approximately 10 to 12 cm long and weigh around 160 grams each. The kidneys guarantee a regulated acid-base balance by filtering excreta and producing urine. Approximately 1,700 liters of blood pass through an adults kidneys every 24 hours. KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION A surgical procedure to implant a kidney from a donor. KOMMANDITGESELLSCHAFT AUF AKTIEN (KGAA) A German entity with its own legal identity in which at least one general partner (personally liable shareholder, or Komple- mentar) has unlimited liability toward the companys credi- tors, while the other shareholders (Kommanditaktionare) par- ticipate in the capital stock that has been broken down into shares, without being personally liable for the companys debts. KT / V Indicator to evaluate treatment quality. It is calculated by put- ting the product of urea clearance through dialysis (K) and the duration of treatment (t) in relation to the filtration rate of cer- tain toxins (V). M MARKET CAPITALIZATION The total value of all outstanding shares of a company. It is cal- culated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the share price. MEDICARE / MEDICAID A health care program developed by the U.S. Social Security Administration that reimburses health insurance companies and providers of medical services for the cost of medical care to individuals over 65, patients with chronic kidney failure ( kidney failure, chronic), the disabled or needy. MEMBRANE A semi-permeable barrier in the dialyzer that separates the blood from the dialysate. O OPERATING INCOME A financial ratio to describe a companys profitability, irrespec- tive of regional taxation and different forms of financing. P PERITONEAL DIALYSIS (PD) A treatment method that uses the patients peritoneum, i.e. the lining covering the inner wall of the abdominal cavity and the abdominal organs, as the dialyzing membrane. A sterile dial- ysate is introduced into the patients abdominal cavity and removed through a catheter that has been surgically implanted. The dialysis solution absorbs toxins and removes them together with excess water. Most treatments are adminis- tered by patients themselves at home or at work several times a day or during the night using a machine  the cycler. Peritoneum Solution bag Drainage bag PHOSPHATE BINDERS Drugs that bind excess phosphate in the intestine that has been ingested via food. Excess phosphate is normally discharged by healthy kidneys. In patients with chronic kidney failure ( kidney failure, chronic), this filtering process can only par- tially be replaced by dialysis. Too much phosphate in the blood can cause numerous adverse effects, such as bone dis- ease, thyroid problems and vascular calcification. POLYSULFONE A polymer (plastic) used to produce dialyzer membranes. It is characterized by extreme thermal stability, chemical resistance and blood compatibility. PREVALENCE Number of patients suffering from a specific disease within a defined period. R RATING A classification of the creditworthiness of a company recog- nized by the international capital markets. It is published by independent rating agencies such as Standard & Poors, Moodys, or Fitch based on a company analysis. REGENERATIVE MEDICINE Approach to completely restore diseased tissue to its original, healthy, and functional state. New technologies include lab- grown biomaterials, tissue engineering, stem cell or gene therapies. ROIC (RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL) Ratio showing operating income after adapted income taxes in relation to the average invested capital of the last five quar- terly balance sheet dates. It provides information on how effi- ciently a company works with its available capital or how effi- ciently the capital is employed for a specific investment project. Fresenius Medical Care calculates its ROIC in euros based on annual figures in accordance with IFRS. S SARBANES-OXLEY ACT (SOX) A law aimed at corporations and their auditors with the objec- tive of improving financial accounting. The goal is to strengthen the confidence of shareholders and other stakeholders in a company by extending regulations relating to financial report- ing and internal monitoring systems. The law strengthens the obligation of company management to provide complete and correct information. The rules apply to all companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) A federal agency that regulates and monitors the U.S. financial markets. SLEEP.SAFE HARMONY A system offering the full range of automated peritoneal dialysis options while ensuring maximum safety and comfort for the patient, physician and nursing staff. U U.S. GAAP United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles V VASCULAR ACCESS, ARTERIOVENOUS (AV) A direct, surgically created connection between an artery (blood vessel carrying blood from the heart to the body) and a vein (blood vessel carrying blood to the heart) in the patients forearm. This connection forms one large blood vessel with an increased blood flow that provides access for hemodialysis. Adequate vascular access is a prerequisite for hemodialysis. VOLATILITY Price fluctuation of a security or currency.

A year after the last wisps of smoke disappeared into the skies from the imposing chimneys of the Moorburg coal plant. By Published A year after the last wisps of smoke disappeared into the skies from the imposing chimneys of the Moorburg coal plant, hopes had grown that the mothballed site would see new life as Germany scrambles to secure energy supplies. Russia s curtailing of gas exports to Germany in the wake of the Ukraine war has forced Berlin to make the radical decision to restart coal power stations, at least temporarily. But infrastructure issues, manpower shortages and logistical problems are proving to be major obstacles for the restart. At Moorburg, operator Vattenfall has dashed hopes of new operations, saying simply that  restarting it would be neither technically, economically nor legally feasible .  Many parts have been dismantled and sold,  said Robert Wacker, director of the site. Even power plants that had not been completely shut, but put in reserve to generate power only occasionally, are struggling with a complete reboot. Further south from Moorburg, energy group Uniper will on Monday fire up its Heyden 4 site, which had been a reserve plant since mid-2021. But the company warned that its output would be affected by railway capacity limits in ferrying hard coal to the site.  Dismantled  Germany began winding down its coal-fired power plants in the last few years, in view of meeting a target to end usage of the fossil fuel by 2030. But Russia s invasion of Ukraine has upended plans as Moscow reduced energy exports to Germany in what Berlin believes is retaliation for its support for Kyiv. Chancellor Olaf Scholz s government has said it would stick to the 2030 coal exit timetable, but in the meantime, it authorised the restart of 27 mothballed plants or those put in reserve to help fill the energy gap until March 2024. With a capacity of 875 megawatts ( MW), Uniper s Heyden 4 figures as the largest on the list. But the Moorburg plant, located in the suburb of Hamburg, had been one of the most modern in the world. It was shut down in the summer of 2021, just six years after it was put into service, in exchange for a public subsidy programme aimed at cutting coal from Germany s energy mix. Since then, the operator has started dismantling and selling the parts that are not necessary for hydrogen  a priority for Germany s future energy sources. Before it closed, the plant churned out around 11 billion kilowatts per year  the equivalent of the electricity consumption for the city of Hamburg. But now, the installation is no longer complete. In the turbines hall, thousands of small components have been packed away into boxes. A rotor, an element that allows the turbine to turn, is packed in aluminium, ready to be sent off. The transformer is also no longer functioning.  Without the transformer, the power plant is no longer linked to the network and can not produce any electricity,  said Vattenfall. Pointing at rust that has accumulated on the components over the last year, the operator s spokesman Gudrun Bode said:  We can t restart a plant just like that.   Retired  With winter round the corner, the race is getting tighter for Germany to ramp up its power generation capacity. But so far, only one  the Mehrum plant with a capacity of 690 MW, has restarted. Besides technical issues, power suppliers are struggling with an acute worker shortage. In Moorburg,  most of those who left have found a job, or are retired,  said Wacker. Energy giant RWE told AFP it is seeking several hundreds of workers as it prepares to reopen three plants with a capacity each of 300 MW. Logistics was also turning out to be tricky, with a drought further putting pressure on the distribution network. The river Rhine has been a key route for coal transport to power plants in the west of the country. But record low water levels over the last week have limited shipments and forced suppliers to turn to rail transport  putting further pressure on strained cargo trains. Uniper has said Heyden 4 s operation will be  limited partly by limits of rail transport capacity bringing coal to the site.  Energy supplier STEAG has also said that it would bring into operation two coal-fire plants from its reserve. It has targeted November as a possible restart date, but it also noted that current rules require sites to have coal supplies for 30 days  something that would be unachievable  given the current tight logistics situation on rail transport . In a bid to unblock the jam, Berlin decided Wednesday to prioritise coal and oil cargo over passenger travel this winter.

It s not just International Women s Day for ministers,  she said while frantically pulling the bouquet apart and handing out individual flowers to the throng around her. She looked decidedly more in her element when she started walking around the camp south of the city of Zakho, joining an all-girls five-a-side football match and crunching into a tackle seconds after kick-off, or hitting uppercuts into punch mitts at a boxing club for girls. Baerbock, Germany s youngest ever foreign minister and the first woman to hold the role, has strong ideas about how diplomacy can better represent women s interests, which she recently presented in a manifesto on  feminist foreign policy . Her critics say the concept is little more concrete than designating a day to celebrate womanhood. But watching Baerbock in action, it is clear that the very act of getting stuck in is a vital part. That the 42-year-old Green politician does not shy from conflict has been apparent to the rest of the world at least since last month s UN general assembly, where she publicly clashed with China while rebutting the claim that the west was escalating the war in Ukraine. Baerbock s persistent harrying of the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in favour of more material military support has won her admirers in Kyiv but also enemies at home. At  peace  rallies in Germany, she has been painted as a warmonger; one party ally from the Greens pacifist wing recently called her  the shrillest trumpeter of Nato s antagonistic new strategy . The programme of her four-day trip to Iraq this week  the longest visit to a foreign state in her 16-month tenure  was also dominated by the repercussion of Russia s war of aggression, as western allies try to hold together an international consensus in condemnation of the invasion. Iraq is situated in what Baerbock diplomatically called a  complicated neighbourhood , with armed conflicts in Syria and Iran repeatedly spilling out on to its turf. And while the prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, needs the US military that remains in the country at his government s request to keep a fragile peace, it is also reliant on gas and electricity imports from Russia-allied Iran. Last month, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, landed in Baghdad with heads of energy companies in tow. Having stayed out of the US-led invasion 20 years ago, Germany has a trusted standing in Iraq that it hopes will allow it to nudge the country away from Iran and Russia s advances. Travelling to Baghdad in Lavrov s wake, Baerbock vowed to keep up support for Iraq s fight against Islamic State, whose command structure was defeated in 2017 but is believed to still have cells in the country waiting their turn. In the presence of German envoys, Iraqi officials on Tuesday signed a deal tasking the German company Siemens Energy to help the country generate up to 6GW of additional homemade electricity. For Baerbock, however, the trip to Iraq is also an opportunity to demonstrate that  feminist foreign policy  could become more than just a slogan. The concept  first championed by Sweden s former foreign minister Margot Wallstrom almost a decade ago, and since claimed with varying degrees of vigour by governments in France, Canada, Chile, the Netherlands and Spain  is not new. But with Sweden s new conservative government recently publicly disowning the concept, Baerbock is now its most prolific champion. In Germany, her guideline paper on  shaping feminist foreign policy  was mocked even in Green-friendly media for relying too heavily on academic jargon and trying to sell established diplomatic practices as a radical fresh start. In Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, Baerbock did not exactly deflect allegations of woolly thinking when she described German support of the war-torn region s military forces as  part of our feminist foreign policy , since  living in dignity does not entail having to hide in your house all day . As an attitude rather than an idea, however, feminist foreign policy proved capable of focusing the minds of the minister and her hosts. At a press conference with the Kurdistan region s prime minister, Masrour Barzani, Baerbock made a statement almost identical to one she had voiced after meeting the Iraqi foreign minister, Fuad Hussein, the previous day and the Nigerian foreign minister in Abuja last December:  Societies live in more stable and peaceful coexistence if women can take part in shaping them,  she said, while holding her male counterpart s gaze. Such comments can risk coming across as lectures delivered mainly to a western audience, especially in a country such as Iraq, with memories of grand speeches about women s liberation as a mere prelude to the US-led invasion 20 years ago. But when presented with a degree of brazenness by a female politician in front of exclusively male counterparts, such lines also have force. When Germany declined to join the US-led invasion in 2003, it was another Green foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, who led the resistance, telling Donald Rumsfeld at the Munich security conference that year he was  not convinced  of the need for military action. Baerbock s inspiration for joining the Greens, however, was not Fischer in 2003 but his decision four years earlier to lead Germany into Kosovo as part of the Nato campaign to stop ethnic cleansing. Iraq to her generation of German Greens is less of a place where the west fatally burned its fingers, than somewhere where it was right to hold out a protecting hand over endangered minorities, as part of an anti-IS coalition in 2014. In Erbil, she urged Barzani to address the situation of children born of Yazidi women who were raped by IS fighters. The Spiritual Council, the highest religious authority among the Iraqi religious minority, said in 2019 it encouraged female Yazidi survivors to return with their children, but explicitly excluded those born of rape since it considers them Muslims. Since Iraqi law requires fathers to authorise passports for minors, most of these children remain in legal limbo.  Like all children in this world these children have human rights,  Baerbock said.  That also means the right to their own surname.  Located about 12 miles from the border with Turkey and surrounded by green fields and rolling hills, the Qadiya camp, where some such children live, holds more than 12,000 people, almost all of them Yazidis who were driven out of the Sinjar region by militias eight years ago. With their homelands still devastated and politically volatile, the number of people in the camp has grown rather than shrunk, and hopelessness has been rising. Germany, which is home to by far the largest Yazidi diaspora community worldwide and whose parliament in January declared IS crimes against the minority a genocide, has a justifiable stake in their fate.  Gender-sensitive budgeting,  one of the phrases from Baerbock s guidelines mocked in the press, may in practice mean nothing more and nothing less than assessing whether all sexes benefit equally from aid projects targeting communities in need such as Iraq s Yazidis, and readdressing the balance if they do not. The project Hawar.help, which the German ministry starts funding in April, offers psychological care and a suicide prevention programme especially for women in Yazidi camps, among whom an estimated 10% have contemplated taking their life.  If we want to have stability in Kurdistan, we need to find ways to bring peace to this region,  said Duzen Tekkal, a German entrepreneur of Kurdish-Yazidi descent who founded Hawar.help.  We need to start recognising that this is a German problem too. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

A year after the last wisps of smoke disappeared into the skies from the imposing chimneys of the Moorburg coal plant. By Published A year after the last wisps of smoke disappeared into the skies from the imposing chimneys of the Moorburg coal plant, hopes had grown that the mothballed site would see new life as Germany scrambles to secure energy supplies. Russia s curtailing of gas exports to Germany in the wake of the Ukraine war has forced Berlin to make the radical decision to restart coal power stations, at least temporarily. But infrastructure issues, manpower shortages and logistical problems are proving to be major obstacles for the restart. At Moorburg, operator Vattenfall has dashed hopes of new operations, saying simply that  restarting it would be neither technically, economically nor legally feasible .  Many parts have been dismantled and sold,  said Robert Wacker, director of the site. Even power plants that had not been completely shut, but put in reserve to generate power only occasionally, are struggling with a complete reboot. Further south from Moorburg, energy group Uniper will on Monday fire up its Heyden 4 site, which had been a reserve plant since mid-2021. But the company warned that its output would be affected by railway capacity limits in ferrying hard coal to the site.  Dismantled  Germany began winding down its coal-fired power plants in the last few years, in view of meeting a target to end usage of the fossil fuel by 2030. But Russia s invasion of Ukraine has upended plans as Moscow reduced energy exports to Germany in what Berlin believes is retaliation for its support for Kyiv. Chancellor Olaf Scholz s government has said it would stick to the 2030 coal exit timetable, but in the meantime, it authorised the restart of 27 mothballed plants or those put in reserve to help fill the energy gap until March 2024. With a capacity of 875 megawatts ( MW), Uniper s Heyden 4 figures as the largest on the list. But the Moorburg plant, located in the suburb of Hamburg, had been one of the most modern in the world. It was shut down in the summer of 2021, just six years after it was put into service, in exchange for a public subsidy programme aimed at cutting coal from Germany s energy mix. Since then, the operator has started dismantling and selling the parts that are not necessary for hydrogen  a priority for Germany s future energy sources. Before it closed, the plant churned out around 11 billion kilowatts per year  the equivalent of the electricity consumption for the city of Hamburg. But now, the installation is no longer complete. In the turbines hall, thousands of small components have been packed away into boxes. A rotor, an element that allows the turbine to turn, is packed in aluminium, ready to be sent off. The transformer is also no longer functioning.  Without the transformer, the power plant is no longer linked to the network and can not produce any electricity,  said Vattenfall. Pointing at rust that has accumulated on the components over the last year, the operator s spokesman Gudrun Bode said:  We can t restart a plant just like that.   Retired  With winter round the corner, the race is getting tighter for Germany to ramp up its power generation capacity. But so far, only one  the Mehrum plant with a capacity of 690 MW, has restarted. Besides technical issues, power suppliers are struggling with an acute worker shortage. In Moorburg,  most of those who left have found a job, or are retired,  said Wacker. Energy giant RWE told AFP it is seeking several hundreds of workers as it prepares to reopen three plants with a capacity each of 300 MW. Logistics was also turning out to be tricky, with a drought further putting pressure on the distribution network. The river Rhine has been a key route for coal transport to power plants in the west of the country. But record low water levels over the last week have limited shipments and forced suppliers to turn to rail transport  putting further pressure on strained cargo trains. Uniper has said Heyden 4 s operation will be  limited partly by limits of rail transport capacity bringing coal to the site.  Energy supplier STEAG has also said that it would bring into operation two coal-fire plants from its reserve. It has targeted November as a possible restart date, but it also noted that current rules require sites to have coal supplies for 30 days  something that would be unachievable  given the current tight logistics situation on rail transport . In a bid to unblock the jam, Berlin decided Wednesday to prioritise coal and oil cargo over passenger travel this winter.

It s not just International Women s Day for ministers,  she said while frantically pulling the bouquet apart and handing out individual flowers to the throng around her. She looked decidedly more in her element when she started walking around the camp south of the city of Zakho, joining an all-girls five-a-side football match and crunching into a tackle seconds after kick-off, or hitting uppercuts into punch mitts at a boxing club for girls. Baerbock, Germany s youngest ever foreign minister and the first woman to hold the role, has strong ideas about how diplomacy can better represent women s interests, which she recently presented in a manifesto on  feminist foreign policy . Her critics say the concept is little more concrete than designating a day to celebrate womanhood. But watching Baerbock in action, it is clear that the very act of getting stuck in is a vital part. That the 42-year-old Green politician does not shy from conflict has been apparent to the rest of the world at least since last month s UN general assembly, where she publicly clashed with China while rebutting the claim that the west was escalating the war in Ukraine. Baerbock s persistent harrying of the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in favour of more material military support has won her admirers in Kyiv but also enemies at home. At  peace  rallies in Germany, she has been painted as a warmonger; one party ally from the Greens pacifist wing recently called her  the shrillest trumpeter of Nato s antagonistic new strategy . The programme of her four-day trip to Iraq this week  the longest visit to a foreign state in her 16-month tenure  was also dominated by the repercussion of Russia s war of aggression, as western allies try to hold together an international consensus in condemnation of the invasion. Iraq is situated in what Baerbock diplomatically called a  complicated neighbourhood , with armed conflicts in Syria and Iran repeatedly spilling out on to its turf. And while the prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, needs the US military that remains in the country at his government s request to keep a fragile peace, it is also reliant on gas and electricity imports from Russia-allied Iran. Last month, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, landed in Baghdad with heads of energy companies in tow. Having stayed out of the US-led invasion 20 years ago, Germany has a trusted standing in Iraq that it hopes will allow it to nudge the country away from Iran and Russia s advances. Travelling to Baghdad in Lavrov s wake, Baerbock vowed to keep up support for Iraq s fight against Islamic State, whose command structure was defeated in 2017 but is believed to still have cells in the country waiting their turn. In the presence of German envoys, Iraqi officials on Tuesday signed a deal tasking the German company Siemens Energy to help the country generate up to 6GW of additional homemade electricity. For Baerbock, however, the trip to Iraq is also an opportunity to demonstrate that  feminist foreign policy  could become more than just a slogan. The concept  first championed by Sweden s former foreign minister Margot Wallstrom almost a decade ago, and since claimed with varying degrees of vigour by governments in France, Canada, Chile, the Netherlands and Spain  is not new. But with Sweden s new conservative government recently publicly disowning the concept, Baerbock is now its most prolific champion. In Germany, her guideline paper on  shaping feminist foreign policy  was mocked even in Green-friendly media for relying too heavily on academic jargon and trying to sell established diplomatic practices as a radical fresh start. In Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, Baerbock did not exactly deflect allegations of woolly thinking when she described German support of the war-torn region s military forces as  part of our feminist foreign policy , since  living in dignity does not entail having to hide in your house all day . As an attitude rather than an idea, however, feminist foreign policy proved capable of focusing the minds of the minister and her hosts. At a press conference with the Kurdistan region s prime minister, Masrour Barzani, Baerbock made a statement almost identical to one she had voiced after meeting the Iraqi foreign minister, Fuad Hussein, the previous day and the Nigerian foreign minister in Abuja last December:  Societies live in more stable and peaceful coexistence if women can take part in shaping them,  she said, while holding her male counterpart s gaze. Such comments can risk coming across as lectures delivered mainly to a western audience, especially in a country such as Iraq, with memories of grand speeches about women s liberation as a mere prelude to the US-led invasion 20 years ago. But when presented with a degree of brazenness by a female politician in front of exclusively male counterparts, such lines also have force. When Germany declined to join the US-led invasion in 2003, it was another Green foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, who led the resistance, telling Donald Rumsfeld at the Munich security conference that year he was  not convinced  of the need for military action. Baerbock s inspiration for joining the Greens, however, was not Fischer in 2003 but his decision four years earlier to lead Germany into Kosovo as part of the Nato campaign to stop ethnic cleansing. Iraq to her generation of German Greens is less of a place where the west fatally burned its fingers, than somewhere where it was right to hold out a protecting hand over endangered minorities, as part of an anti-IS coalition in 2014. In Erbil, she urged Barzani to address the situation of children born of Yazidi women who were raped by IS fighters. The Spiritual Council, the highest religious authority among the Iraqi religious minority, said in 2019 it encouraged female Yazidi survivors to return with their children, but explicitly excluded those born of rape since it considers them Muslims. Since Iraqi law requires fathers to authorise passports for minors, most of these children remain in legal limbo.  Like all children in this world these children have human rights,  Baerbock said.  That also means the right to their own surname.  Located about 12 miles from the border with Turkey and surrounded by green fields and rolling hills, the Qadiya camp, where some such children live, holds more than 12,000 people, almost all of them Yazidis who were driven out of the Sinjar region by militias eight years ago. With their homelands still devastated and politically volatile, the number of people in the camp has grown rather than shrunk, and hopelessness has been rising. Germany, which is home to by far the largest Yazidi diaspora community worldwide and whose parliament in January declared IS crimes against the minority a genocide, has a justifiable stake in their fate.  Gender-sensitive budgeting,  one of the phrases from Baerbock s guidelines mocked in the press, may in practice mean nothing more and nothing less than assessing whether all sexes benefit equally from aid projects targeting communities in need such as Iraq s Yazidis, and readdressing the balance if they do not. The project Hawar.help, which the German ministry starts funding in April, offers psychological care and a suicide prevention programme especially for women in Yazidi camps, among whom an estimated 10% have contemplated taking their life.  If we want to have stability in Kurdistan, we need to find ways to bring peace to this region,  said Duzen Tekkal, a German entrepreneur of Kurdish-Yazidi descent who founded Hawar.help.  We need to start recognising that this is a German problem too. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

In addition, countries and territories around the world continue to struggle with multiple forms of malnutrition.', 'It is estimated that almost 690 million people around the world experienced hunger in 2019, equivalent to 8.9 per cent of the world population \\u2013 an increase of\\\\xa0nearly 60 million in five years.

However, these figures may rise as a result of continued constraints on access to nutritious food and essential nutrition services during the pandemic, the full impact of which may take years to manifest.', 'In 2020, wasting (low weight for height) and overweight affected 6.7 per cent (45.4 million) and 5.7 per cent (38.9 million) of children under the age of 5, respectively. Wasting will be one of the conditions most affected by the pandemic in the short term: around 15 per cent more children than estimated may have suffered from wasting as a result of a decline in household wealth and disruptions in the availability and affordability of nutritious food and essential nutrition services. Childhood overweight (high weight for height) may also rise in some countries and territories where unhealthy foods replaced fresh, nutritious foodstuffs and restrictions on movement constrained opportunities for physical activity for long periods.', 'In women, anaemia increases the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. In 2019, the global prevalence of anaemia was 29.9 per cent in women of reproductive age, 29.6 per cent in non-pregnant women and 36.5 per cent in pregnant women. The prevalence was higher in Central and Southern Asia, at 47.5 per cent in women of reproductive age.', 'The average agricultural output per labour day of small-scale food producers in the limited number of countries and territories surveyed is lower than that of large - scale producers, who also earn up to two or three times the annual income of smallscale producers. In almost all countries and territories surveyed, households headed by males achieve higher labour productivity and earn larger annual incomes compared to their female counterparts.', 'Global holdings of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture in 2020 reached 5.7 million accessions conserved in 831 gene banks by 114 countries and territories and 17 regional and international research centres. Although the total number of global holdings has risen, the growth rate decreased over the past 10 years, reaching its lowest level in 2020.', 'The world is still far off target for maintaining the genetic diversity of farmed and domesticated animals, either in the field or in gene banks. The risk status of 61 per cent of local livestock breeds remains unknown.

The decline reflects a shift away from aid for financing infrastructure and production towards a greater focus on social sectors.', 'In 2016, 21 countries experienced high or moderately high domestic prices, relative to their historic levels, for one or more staple cereal food commodities. Thirteen of those countries were in sub-Saharan Africa. The main causes of high prices were declines in domestic output, currency depreciation and insecurity.

However, more than 790 million people worldwide still lack regular access to adequate amounts of dietary energy. If current trends continue, the zero hunger target will be largely missed by 2030. Many countries that failed to reach the target set as part of the Millennium Development Goals, of halving the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, have faced natural and human-induced disasters or political instability, resulting in protracted crises, with increased vulnerability and food insecurity affecting large parts of the population. The persistence of hunger is no longer simply a matter of food availability. More and better data on access to food can enable the tracking of progress and guide interventions to fight food insecurity and malnutrition.', 'Globally, in 2014, nearly 1 in 4 children under the age of 5, an estimated total of 159 million children, had stunted growth. Stunting is defined as inadequate height for age, an indicator of the cumulative effects of undernutrition and infection. Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa accounted for three quarters of the children under 5 with stunted growth in 2014. Another aspect of child malnutrition is the growing share of children who are overweight, a problem affecting nearly every region. Globally, between 2000 and 2014, the percentage of children under the age of 5 who were overweight grew from 5.1 per cent to 6.1 per cent.', 'Ending hunger and malnutrition relies heavily on sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices. Genetic diversity in livestock breeds is crucial for agriculture and food production since it allows for the raising of farm animals in a wide range of environments and provides the basis for diverse products and services. Globally, 20 per cent of local livestock breeds, meaning breeds reported in only one country, are at risk of extinction. Another 16 per cent of breeds are stable, and the status of the remaining local breeds is unknown owing to a lack of data.

According to data from 67 of 153 countries that share transboundary waters, the average percentage of national transboundary basins covered by an operational arrangement was 59 per cent in the period 2017\\u20132018, with only 17 countries reporting that all their transboundary basins were covered by such arrangements.', 'Following several years of steady increases and after reaching $9 billion in 2016, ODA disbursements to the water sector declined by 2 per cent from 2016 to 2017. However, ODA commitments to the water sector jumped by 36 per cent between 2016 and 2017, indicating a renewed focus by donors on the sector.', 'Source: Report of the Secretary-General,', 'Special edition: progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals', 'Too many people still lack access to safely managed water supplies and sanitation facilities. Water scarcity, flooding and lack of proper wastewater management also hinder social and economic development. Increasing water efficiency and improving water management are critical to balancing the competing and growing water demands from various sectors and users.', 'In 2015, 29 per cent of the global population lacked safely managed drinking water supplies, and 61 per cent were without safely managed sanitation services. In 2015, 892 million people continued to practise open defecation.', 'In 2015, only 27 per cent of the population in LDCs had basic handwashing facilities.', 'Preliminary estimates from household data of 79 mostly high- and high-middle-income countries (excluding much of Africa and Asia) suggest that 59 per cent of all domestic wastewater is safely treated.', 'In 22 countries, mostly in the Northern Africa and Western Asia region and in the Central and Southern Asia region, the water stress level is above 70 per cent, indicating the strong probability of future water scarcity.', 'In 2017\\u20132018, 157 countries reported average implementation of integrated water resources management of 48 per cent.', 'Based on data from 62 out of 153 countries sharing transboundary waters, the average percentage of national transboundary basins covered by an operational arrangement was only 59 per cent in 2017.', 'Source: Report of the Secretary-General,', 'The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2018', 'Access to safe water and sanitation and sound management of freshwater ecosystems are essential to human health and to environmental sustainability and economic prosperity.', 'In 2015, 6.6 billion people (over 90 per cent of the world\\u2019s population) used improved drinking water sources and 4.9 billion people (over two thirds of the world\\u2019s population) used improved sanitation facilities. In both cases, people without access live predominantly in rural areas. Achieving universal access to basic sanitation and ending the unsafe practice of open defecation will require substantial acceleration of progress in rural areas of Central and Southern Asia, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.', 'Effective water and sanitation management relies on the participation of a range of stakeholders, including local communities. A 2016-2017 survey found that over 80 per cent of 74 responding countries had clearly defined procedures for engaging service users/communities in water and sanitation management.', 'More than 2 billion people globally are living in countries with excess water stress, defined as the ratio of total freshwater withdrawn to total renewable freshwater resources above a threshold of 25 per cent. Northern Africa and Western Asia experience water stress levels above 60 per cent, which indicates the strong probability of future water scarcity.', 'In 2012, 65 per cent of the 130 countries that responded to a survey on integrated water resources management reported that management plans were in place at the national level.', 'ODA for the water sector has been rising steadily, but has remained relatively constant as a proportion of total ODA disbursements, at approximately 5 per cent since 2005. In 2015, ODA disbursements in the water sector totalled about $8.6 billion, which represents an increase of 67 per cent in real terms since 2005.', 'Source: Report of the Secretary-General, \\\"Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals\\\",', 'E/2017/66', 'Water and sanitation are at the very core of sustainable development, critical to the survival of people and the planet. Goal 6 not only addresses the issues relating to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, but also the quality and sustainability of water resources worldwide.', 'In 2015, 4.9 billion people globally used an improved sanitation facility; 2.4 billion did not. Among those lacking adequate sanitation were 946 million people without any facilities at all, who continued to practise open defecation. In 2015, 68 per cent of the global population was using improved sanitation facilities compared to 59 per cent in 2000. Nevertheless, the unsafe management of faecal waste and wastewater continues to present a major risk to public health and the environment.', 'More progress has been made in access to drinking water. In 2015, 6.6 billion people, or 91 per cent of the global population, used an improved drinking water source, versus 82 per cent in 2000. Despite that improvement, an estimated 663 million people were using unimproved water sources or surface water that year. While coverage was around 90 per cent or more in all regions except sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, widespread inequalities persist within and among countries. Moreover, not all improved sources are safe. For instance, in 2012 it was estimated that at least 1.8 billion people were exposed to drinking water sources contaminated with faecal matter.', 'Holistic management of the water cycle means taking into account the level of \\u201cwater stress\\u201d, calculated as the ratio of total fresh water withdrawn by all major sectors to the total renewable fresh water resources in a particular country or region. Currently, water stress affects more than 2 billion people around the world, a figure that is projected to rise. Already, water stress affects countries on every continent and hinders the sustainability of natural resources, as well as economic and social development. In 2011, 41 countries experienced water stress, an increase from 36 countries in 1998. Of those, 10 countries, on the Arabian Peninsula, in Central Asia and in Northern Africa, withdrew more than 100 per cent of their renewable fresh water resources.', 'Integrated water resources management, one of the follow-up actions to the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg Plan of Implementation), aims to address this urgent situation. In 2012, 65 per cent of the 130 countries that responded to a survey question on integrated water resources management reported that management plans were in place at the national level.', 'Total official flows for water and sanitation were $10 billion in 2014, of which total aid flows from DAC donors amounted to $8 billion. Aid for water and sanitation nearly doubled as a share of ODA during the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (1981-1990). Since that time, on average, it has remained at around 7 per cent of total aid flows. Better targeting and tracking of water aid within the context of national situations is needed. For instance, numerous countries with limited access to water supply and/or sanitation have been receiving minimal external assistance (typically less than $2 per capita annually), while other countries with higher levels of access have received much more (at least $30 per capita a year).', 'Effective water and sanitation management also depends on the participation of stakeholders. According to a 2013-2014 Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water survey, 83 per cent of the 94 countries surveyed reported that procedures for stakeholder participation were clearly defined in law or policy. In the Sustainable Development Goals, the focus is being refined to also include the participation of local communities, which will be captured in the next cycle of Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water monitoring.', 'Source: Report of the Secretary-General, \\\"Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals\\\",', 'E/2016/75']\"\n        ],\n

Incredibly intense. Incredibly challenging. Incredibly successful. We invested in the expansion and operation of our networks to the tune of some 18 billion euros. Consequently, by the end of the year, we had made our 5G network in Germany available to more than 90 percent of the population, for example, and we also further increased our 5G network lead over our competitors in the United States. We attracted millions of new customers and delivered strong financial results. Deutsche Telekom is one of the most valu- able brands in the world and we are currently the leading Euro- pean telecommunications provider by a very considerable margin. Once again, successes such as these are a great incentive to me to ensure we also take a leading role in relation to our social and ecological responsibility. Act responsibly is a key and integral component of our Group Timotheus Httges, Chairman of the Board of Management, Bonn, Germany strategy. To underline the growing relevance of sustainable action, Michael Hagspihl, as Head of Corporate Responsibility, has We are working with our suppliers to make our product range reported to me directly since January 1, 2022.

Our technicians provided interim solutions while the rebuilding work was being carried out. We won t stop until everyone can #TAKEPART. This means not only ensuring technical access to fast networks, but also boosting people s ability to use digital media proficiently. We are working to ensure that all people have equal opportunity to be a part of the digital society. That s why, in 2021, we continued our campaign against online hate and for more online civil courage. We report extensively on these and many other sustainability activities in this year s Sustainability Report. We remain committed to the principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the German Sustainability Code. Both of these frameworks, along with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, guide us in what we do. Digitalization offers many opportunities  C it creates potential for protecting the climate and conserving resources, simplifies our working world, and enriches our personal everyday lives.

In addition, the principle of responsible cor- porate governance remains an important component of our sus- tainability activities. During the year under review, we brought many of our CR topics together under the headings #GreenMagenta and #GoodMa- genta, with the aim of positioning our commitment to sustainabil- ity more strongly in our communication with stakeholder groups such as employees and customers. We also use these two catego- ries to label products and initiatives of ours that bring sustainabil- ity benefits. These labels help us increase the transparency of our CR communication. We also aim to increase transparency for CR experts by bringing our CR strategy in line with the ESG perspec- tives. You can find additional information on our Group strategy in the 2021 annual report. Our CR (Corporate Responsibility) strategy is derived from the Group strategy. During the year under review, we have continued to refine our CR strategy. While the CR strategy s defining priori- ties remain the same, the strategy is being refined in keeping with partial overlaps that have emerged between three of the CR strategy s action areas, Connected life and work  C enabling a sustainable lifestyle in a digital world,  Connecting the  and Low-carbon society.

This is one of the main reasons why, in the year under review, we added CR controlling, as a strategically relevant process, to our Internal Control System (ICS). The ICS principles defined for CR controlling are oriented to high data quality, process timeliness and transparency, and Group-wide coherence of performance indicators. In the coming years, we plan to introduce transaction controls. In the most important national companies, such controls will intensify internal auditing of processes relative to energy con- sumption and the purchase of certificates for renewable energies and CO emissions.

Strategy 9 CR strategy & management Our management tools  C the ESG key performance indicators Development of our ESG KPIs ESG KPIs (key performance indicators) are used as management tools for our CR activities. Since they are highly relevant, we also publish them in the combined non-financial statement of our annual report. Our national companies assist in the collection of Group-wide ESG KPIs by recording CR data themselves. These national companies represent 99 percent of the Group s net revenue. For the purpose of integrated financial and sustainability reporting, the KPIs map all six types of capital (see diagram).

Our Group is broken down into five operating segments: We are convinced that commercial, social, and ecological aspects can complement each other. We aim to make a positive contribu- tion to sustainable development throughout our entire value chain. The overall responsibility for Corporate Responsibility (CR) lies with our Board of Management; it deliberates and decides on important matters pertaining to CR. The Group Corporate Respon- sibility (GCR) department develops Group-wide policies and guidelines with the goal of steadily advancing the corporate cul- ture with regard to sustainable innovation and social responsibility. As of January 1, 2022, GCR has been transferred from the Human Resources and Legal Affairs Board department into the area of the Chief Executive Officer. By taking this step, and including ESG targets in Board of Management remuneration, we are again high- lighting the great importance that Corporate Responsibility has for our Group. Reporting against standards In connection with the move, Birgit Klesper, who has headed the CR department for 13 years, as Senior Vice President for Group Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Corporate Responsibility, will hand over the leadership of the GRI 102-1, GRI 102-2, GRI 102-6, GRI 102-7, GRI 102-18, GRI 102-1, department to Michael Hagspihl. Birgit Klesper has helped the Group reach key milestones in efforts to enshrine CR in Group GRI 102-20 (General Disclosures) principles, and to emphasize the importance of CR. These accom- plishments range from development of the company s CR strategy to integration of Act responsibly within the Group strategy. Numerous successes such as the following demonstrate that Deutsche Telekom is well on its way to becoming a leading sus- tainable telco: we are listed in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, as the third-best telecommunications company worldwide, and as the best in Europe; we are included, for the 6th time in a row, in CDP s A List for Climate Change, in recognition of our efforts to combat climate change; and we are the recipient of intense media coverage, and of a highly positive public reception, for our policies and activities against online hate speech, discrimination, and fake news. Birgit Klesper retired as of January 1, 2022. In order to always ensure a direct exchange between CR and our core busi- ness, the CR Board advises GCR. This board is made up of the heads of the main Group units.

Our Group-level HSE management system is covered by an umbrella certificate based on the international standards ISO 45001 (formerly OHSAS 18001) for occupational health and safety and ISO 14001 for environmental management. For some units, it also covers international standard ISO 9001 for quality manage- ment. Some of the national companies are not covered by an umbrella certificate because they have their own certifications, some of which are even more comprehensive. This is the case in Greece, for example. The OTE Group has an integrated management system. In addition to the above-mentioned standards, it also covers the international standards ISO 50001 for energy management and ISO 27001 for data security.

In the case of many topics that are highly important, pursuant to our materiality analysis, the pertinent risks for our company are com- prehensively evaluated by the responsible person(s) within the Group  C such as staff in the areas of Compliance or Data Privacy. Such supplementary analysis gives us a clearer perspective of the relevant impacts on the environment and society, and it helps us to pair our risk analysis with strategic opportunity assessment. On the basis of the most important sustainability issues involved, we have developed various possible scenarios. In one, for example, disruptive, new products can help solve existing social, economic or ecological problems. On the other hand, adverse environmental impacts, such as larger quantities of produced waste, can increase costs (in this case, costs for waste management). Such scenarios have been evaluated by experts in terms of their probability of occurrence and their financial impacts. On the basis of such evalu- ation, the risks and opportunities linked to the scenarios have been grouped into the categories low, medium and high. The analysis indicates that, currently, the supply chain and cli- mate-related issues present high risks for society, for the environ- ment and for us as a company  C for example, pollutants released in the supply chain can adversely affect human health, and tighter legal requirements can lead to higher costs for us. For years now, these issues have been taken into account in Deutsche Telekom s overarching risk-and-opportunity management process, and they are reported in detail each year in our annual report. On the other hand, our products and services can help solve ecological and social challenges. For example, we offer solutions that help reduce energy consumption. Such challenges, therefore, offer opportuni- ties for sustainable development, as well as market opportunities for us.

The guide presents best practices, methods, and tips for applying the AI Guidelines to develop- ment processes. With this guide, we are seeking to ensure that all developers who work with AI are able to conform to the AI Guidelines and implement them in the systems and products they develop. The Robust AI Assessment project is part of our overarching efforts to link state-of-the-art technologies to ethical stand- ards. In a cooperative effort with experts of Israel s Ben Gurion University, and the German start-up Neurocat, AI experts of Telekom Innovation Laboratories are working to measure and analyze the robustness of internal and external AI-based prod- ucts and services, with a view to identifying potential for improvements. In addition, we have added the AI Guidelines to the curricula for various training courses for our employees. For example, we have developed relevant training events for our Data Scientist training program and our Re-Skilling Academy, and we offer these events in various attractive formats in the framework of Telekom Vocational Training, including virtual tours, online training and Digital Learning Journeys. Further development of the Compliance organization Due to the increasing challenges in our market environment and changes in the working world, we are constantly adjusting the range of duties covered by Compliance. With means of needs- oriented and ad hoc training courses, we also keep Compliance employees up to date in terms of knowledge and skills. In 2020, we launched and further developed the Compliance Next Level transformation initiative, with a view to preparing our Compliance organization for growing customer requirements, both internal and external, and for digital and agile modes of work. Since October 2021, the Group Compliance Management area has been using agile work processes. By concentrating training on the topic areas Innovation, Business Ethics and Risk Mitigation, we are seeking to uphold staff s thoroughgoing customer centricity and their capabilities to respond  C collaboratively, quickly and appropriately  C to changes in the Compliance sector. In this context, we have offered employees an extensive range of training measures, such as training focused on agility. These measures have met with broad interest and generated fruitful discussion.

In order to drive network expansion, network operators in Germany need investment incentives, legal and regulatory planning security, and technological freedom of action. That enables them to respond flexibly to the circumstances of enterprises and house- holds and meet political, economic, and social requirements. This is the only way to fully harness the potential for cost-effective private network expansion using all available technologies. When it comes to areas where cost-effective broadband expansion is not possible, it is up to the public sector to ensure the gaps are plugged by providing technology- and supplier-neutral funding programs and exercising sound judgment. Legal frameworks and regulatory practice need to actively support private-sector investment in new fiber-optic networks and prevent unnecessary financial burdens and red tape for the network operators investing in networks. In view of the fact that the internet and telecommunications markets are converging rapidly, and in light of the growing market power of a few global internet players, the sector-specific regula- tion of telecommunications that has been pursued to date is creating more and more of an imbalance. The same laws and regulations that apply to telecommunications companies also need to apply to internet companies providing the same services. The objective here must be to create equal competitive conditions and enable fair distribution of the financial burden involved in broadband expansion.

In this respect not only are the taxes levied on the profit of the enterprise or group of companies taken into account, further types of taxes are also addressed, which can be quite substantial, in particular also in the telecommunications sector. Moreover, the so-called Taxes Borne as well as so-called Taxes Collected are included in the approach in order to comprehensively visualize the financial weight of the enterprise and its activity for the public domain. For example, it also illustrates the aspects of employment and value-added through the presentation of wage taxes, social contributions and value-added taxes. As a consequence, a differ- entiated and therefore meaningful picture results regarding the positive financial impact on the public community in connection with the enterprise and its activity. In addition, this approach can also show national differences in the tax frameworks.

The following charts show the Total Tax Contribution 2020 of the Research and development group companies addressed. As a future-oriented telecommunications business, we support and participate in ongoing research. We collaborate with various universities. For example, we established a professorship for soft- ware engineering (with a focus on blockchain) at the CODE Univer- sity of Applied Sciences in Berlin. We invest in various fields of research such as the Internet of Things (IoT). We invested a total of 33 million euros in research and development within the Group in 2021. We promote young and innovative business ideas. In the frame- work of our hubraum technology incubator, start-ups benefit from our experience, receive financial support and obtain access to exclusive technologies. We bring young participating companies together with relevant business units within the Group, for the pur- pose of testing innovative technologies and new business models and bringing them to the market. In 2021, our technology incuba- tor collaborated with about 100 start-ups. With our Deutsche Telekom hubraum 5G Sustainability Award, we highlight efforts by industry and start-ups to bring about a sus- tainable world. The award honors projects with a focus on the sus- tainability of 5G networks, such as projects in the areas of smart infrastructure and AI-controlled (AI = artificial intelligence) energy management. In the year under review, hubraum, in cooperation with Bundesver- band Deutsche Startups (German start-ups association), produced a study of AI-oriented start-ups in Germany that highlights the promise and strengths of the German AI ecosystem. The study's Economy 53 Sustainable finance key results include the finding that young AI companies, while enormously ambitious, tend to lack resources and impetus for growth. At the same time, the study also found that women are underrepresented in the AI sector, and that this situation needs to change, in light of the need for participatory, unbiased AI systems  C and of the insight that diversity in AI-developer teams reduces bias in the resulting AI systems. In this regard, the study was able to offer a positive outlook, by reporting that 81 percent of AI start-ups believe that AI-technology development needs to take account of ethical issues.

Economy 54 Suppliers Suppliers Our approach to sustainable procurement Encompassing the entire procurement process, our Group-wide sustainable procurement strategy is put into action using internal and external performance indicators and management tools. Until the end of 2021, the responsibility for ensuring sustaina- bility in procurement lay with the following two Board of Man- agement departments: a) Finance and b) Human Resources and Legal Affairs. As of January 1, 2022, this responsibility now lies with the Chairman of the Board of Management s depart- ment and the Board of Management department for Finance.

Auditing procedures We focus our audit activities on strategically important and par- ticularly risky suppliers. They are routinely audited every two to three years. This group includes roughly 250 of our 20 000 or so active suppliers. Together, they cover around 80 percent of our procurement volume. These audits give us transparency about the risks in large parts of our supply chain. Economy 57 Suppliers The majority of the audits are conducted within the scope of Joint 2021 audit results Audit Cooperation (JAC).

This rating assesses how well companies have been able to integrate the topic of climate protection into their supply chain. In 2021, we were awarded an A rating, as in the previous year. This has secured our place on the Supplier Engagement Leader Board. An important step in achieving this was calculating the supplier- specific emission intensities based on supplier responses to the CDP Supply Chain Program. This involved calculating the ratio between a supplier s overall emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 and Scope 3 for the upstream supply chain) and the supplier s overall sales. The ESG KPI CDP Supply Chain Program indicates the degree to which our procurement volume from carbon-intensive suppliers is covered by the CDP Supply Chain Program. In 2021, 72 percent of the procurement volume was covered by the CDP Supply Chain Program.

Responsible procurement of raw materials We require our suppliers to protect the environment and use resources responsibly. This requirement is enshrined both in our Code of Human Rights & Social Principles and in our Supplier Code of Conduct. As a form of verification, we request our suppliers to disclose information about their activities and we perform supplier audits (social audits). In these audits, we check whether our suppliers use an environmental management system, including a waste man- agement system, and review how they manage their energy and water consumption. In addition, we always check whether there is a management system in place to address the issue of conflict resources. When selecting suppliers and products, we review and evaluate, for example, the use of hazardous and conflict materials  C espe- cially in light of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains. In 2021, we reviewed and adjusted our sustainabil- ity criteria. As of 2022, the new criteria are also being applied to selected (high-volume) invitations to tender for supply of IT and network hardware products, and entering into supplier selections, with a weighting of 20 percent.

Economy 64 Sustainable and innovative products Deutsche Telekom supports companies, municipalities, and schools in accessing financial support available for forward- looking investments Digitalization offers enormous opportunities. Throughout a spec- trum ranging from the Internet of Things (IoT) to big data and arti- ficial intelligence, digital technologies and solutions are facilitating the development of innovative products that have greater energy efficiency and/or durability and can simplify production and work processes. Also, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, digitalized companies and municipalities are more resilient  C and better able to handle challenges and crises. In summer 2020, the German Government approved a Future Package, an extensive economic stimulus package designed to stabilize the German economy and equip Germany for the future. The package, which includes a raft of measures aimed at support- ing digitalization in private-sector companies, the public sector, and education, boosts Germany s existing funding scene with far- reaching additional impetus. Under the effort, Germany s federal and Lnder (state) governments are subsidizing digitalization pro- jects at rates of up to 70 percent of the relevant costs (and even more, in some cases). Deutsche Telekom is also seeking to provide additional impetus in the area of funding, and thereby support companies, municipali- ties, and schools even more effectively in their digital transforma- tion processes. Our Group program Schubkraft (Thrust) (only available in German), for example, offers free pertinent advising, along with practical support in accessing funding opportunities. With our Quick-Check service (only available in German), compa- nies can quickly determine, at no charge, whether their projects are eligible for funding, as well as what funding programs are suit- able for the projects. The service is available both online and in the Meine Frderung (My Funding) app. In addition, we offer indi- vidual consultations, provide support (in cooperation with part- ners) for application processes and assist companies in preparing digitalization plans that can serve as a basis for obtaining funding. Our efforts on behalf of the non-profit association BePro Velbert e. V. provide a good example of our activities in this area. hanks to the funding it received, this association has been able to move forward significantly with digitalization. For example, it is now using a digi- tal point of sale (POS) system. BePro Velbert offers job opportuni- ties to long-term unemployed persons, and thereby helps them to re-enter the workplace. In order to stay in touch with the modern workplace, the association regularly invests in new equipment. One case in point involved the said digital POS system. Via a con- tact to Deutsche Telekom s sales area, the association was put in touch with the company s Schubkraft team. Then, in a customer workshop, the vision and the framework for the association s pro- ject were discussed. In a next step, Schubkraft researched the available funding programs and helped the association submit its application. Shortly thereafter, the association s funding applica- tion was approved.

We follow the coverage requirements of Bundesnetzagentur (BNetzA, Federal Network Agency) in expanding the mobile net- work. By the end of 2021, we provided almost 99 percent of households with LTE coverage. In addition, we have been providing broadband service, with bandwidth of 50 or 100 Mbps, along more and more traffic routes. Already, over 90 percent of people in Germany now have access to Deutsche Telekom's fast, new 5G mobile network.

We slightly missed the target of achieving 99 percent LTE coverage in Europe by 2021 with a value of 98.2 percent and instead continued to drive for- ward the further development of our networks with 5G and FTTH. Furthermore, more than 34.5 million households in Germany can already order a rate with up to 100 Mbit/s on our fixed network. Economy 66 Network expansion and wireless service for 250 000 people was temporarily dis- Number of fixed network customers rupted. Cellular capacities were then increased using mobile masts and special antennas fitted to existing masts. As a result of these efforts, cellular service was completely restored in the flood- damaged areas within the space of only a week. In addition, some 97 percent of the 103 000 fixed network accesses that had been destroyed were repaired by the end of the year. As a stopgap measure, we provide affected customers with free LTE or hybrid routers, along with unlimited data allowances for calling and inter- net usage. In the hardest-hit regions, existing copper-wire accesses that had been damaged or destroyed are not being restored; instead, they are being replaced with fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) fiber-optic accesses. As part of these efforts, we plan to install some 40 000 new fiber-optic accesses in the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia. In January 2022, we began this fiber- optic expansion in the cities of Dernau, Mayschoss, and Rech. In 2022, an additional 25 000 FTTH accesses will be added. Reporting against standards Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) TC-TL-550a.2 (Managing Systemic Risks from Technology Disruptions) Rollout of the new 5G mobile generation A total of 63 000 antennas are now operating at the 5G standard in Deutsche Telekom s network (as of December 2021). As of the end of 2021 this new mobile communications standard was availa- ble to over 90 percent of all households in Germany. Most of the antennas transmit on the 2.1 GHz frequency, both in large cities and in smaller communities and rural areas. 5G on the fast 3.6 GHz frequency band is available in more than 140 cities (as of December 2021). 3 600 antennas are now in place, at a total of over 1 200 locations. As a result, more and more people are now able to enjoy high-speed 5G service. Deutsche Telekom decommissioned its 3G network in Germany in 2021. The frequencies that have become available as a result are now being used for 5G and LTE service. In other words, more band- width is now available for these two newer, and considerably more powerful, technologies. Continuing expansion of the fiber-optic network Deutsche Telekom s fiber-optic network is the largest in Europe, with a length of over 650 000 kilometers in Germany alone (as of December 2021). As global data traffic continues to grow rapidly, we are continuing to expand our fiber-optic network. To do this as quickly and efficiently as possible, we use planning software and modern deployment methods such as trenching. We use our expansion tracker for Germany (only available in German) to illus- trate our progress. To expand the fiber-optic network, we are using FTTC (fiber to the curb) technology with super vectoring and are expanding FTTH (fiber to the home) as well.

Economy 68 Customer satisfaction Our surveys are conducted either directly after a contact (for example, via the hotline, in a shop, on a field service call, or after an online inquiry by email or chat) or a completed process (for exam- ple, after service provisioning). If a customer tells us in a survey that their request has not yet been resolved, a callback offer is made to clarify the request once and for all. The results of customer surveys are also used for internal training of our customer advisors. Measuring customer retention and endorsement We use the TRI*M index to gauge customer retention and regularly participate in benchmarking. The recorded data is based on a cus- tomer survey conducted in all markets and segments (except T-Mobile US). To measure the TRI*M value, customers are asked four standardized questions  C for example, whether they would recommend Deutsche Telekom to others; their answers are com- piled in a key performance indicator. The TRI*M value for the Deutsche Telekom Group is calculated as an overall value from the individual measurement results of the countries or segments. At the end of the year under review, the indicator for the Group (excluding T-Mobile US) came in at 73.4 points versus an adjusted value of 72.7 points at the start of the year (both determined on a comparable basis). As a result, the index value improved, and we achieved our Group aim of increasing it slightly. The Germany and T-Systems operating segments contributed to the positive devel- opment with improvements in customer loyalty. The TRI*M index for Germany, at 69.2 points, is slightly higher than in the previous year (69.0). Also, it is considerably higher, for both consumers and business customers, than the comparable figures of the competition. In our EU business segment, we experienced a slight decrease, from 68.6 to 68.4, while the TRI*M index for T-Systems increased from 87 to 90 points. In sum, we once again reached our overall goal of a slight increase for the Group as a whole. Our goal for 2022 is to achieve another slight increase for the Group as a whole. Customer satisfaction and loyalty scores are factored into both the long-term variable remuneration scheme for our board members and, to an extent, the performance assessments of our managers, meaning some of their variable salary components are linked to these ratings.

Economy 71 Consumer protection The effects of EMFs have been thoroughly researched over the past decades in numerous scientific studies. The World Health Organization (WHO) analyzes the findings of scientific research and most recently made a statement regarding the results in 2014. In its statement, it concludes that the current threshold values for EMFs ensure that mobile communications technology can be used safely and further development should be accompanied by research. In 2020, after evaluating current scientific research, the ICNIRP once again confirmed the protection concept for EMFs, as they occur in mobile communications. According to ICNIRP, the threshold values ensure comprehensive protection for people and the environment. This also applies to frequency ranges used by 5G, because, like earlier network types, 5G requires high security standards. Safe operation of mobile communications technology in Germany is therefore ensured. In 2021, the online portal Informationszentrum Mobilfunk (center for information about mobile communications), working in cooper- ation with three municipal umbrella associations, expanded its offerings for municipalities and published a new brochure (only available in German), entitled Mobile communications and health (Mobilfunk und Gesundheit), for municipal decision-makers. In addition, working in cooperation with various media, the portal carried out informational events, and an experts  conference for representatives of Bavarian municipalities, on the expansion of 5G network service. At the end of 2021, Informationszentrum Mobilfunk (only available in German) published a video on socially relevant 5G applications. In cooperation with the three other 5G licensees in Germany, Telef nica Germany, Vodafone, and 1&1 Mobilfunk, we support Informationszentrum Mobilfunk. The portal provides objective, scientifically reliable information about basic issues relating to mobile communications, including controversial issues, in the areas of health and safety, technology and network expansions, the environment and sustainability, and politics and legal ques- tions.

The findings of the survey are used, for example, to determine the Security Awareness Index (SAI) and the Data Protection Award indicator. The indicators help us to review the effectiveness of our measures in the areas of IT security and data protection. The data protection award indicator was last measured in 2020 and stood at 86 percent (without T-Mobile US). In the last survey in 2021, security awareness reached 80.9 (without T-Mobile US) of maxi- mum 100 points (which is higher than for all other companies in the benchmark). The Data Protection Award indicator measures the level of data protection within the units on a scale of 0 to 12. It is calculated based on what the employees said they thought, did and knew about data protection.

Our Corporate Responsibility Strategy is derived from this. It covers three action areas: Climate protection & resource efficiency, Digital responsibility, and Digi- tal participation. The climate strategy translates the action area Climate protection & resource efficiency into concrete measures. This is how we ensure that climate protection measures are closely connected with our core business. To support the climate strategy and achieve the ambitious Group targets, the national companies have developed and implemented their own climate protection strategies, concepts and measures. These can be viewed in the relevant profiles. Our integrated climate strategy is based on four pillars: Emissions from the value chain; renewable energy; energy efficiency; and enablement: positive climate protection effects for our customers. We have defined objectives and/or key performance indicators for each of the four pillars. The Group Corporate Responsibility department (GCR) had responsibility for coordinating the #GreenMagenta Program for Germany in 2021. Activities of the national companies were coor- dinated by the Board member for Deutsche Telekom s Europe seg- ment, with the support of GCR. Within the program framework, Deutsche Telekom s departments in Germany and in the national companies carried out numerous measures under their own responsibility. In 2020, intensive international collaboration within the #GreenMagenta Program framework began, and this contin- ued in the year under review. The aim of such collaboration is to synchronize the program activities in the various countries as effectively as possible and to establish regular exchanges between the departments responsible for the program s implementation.

Raising employee awareness Employees also play an important role in reducing our carbon footprint at T-Systems. To this end, T-Systems is reducing business travel and relying on videoconferencing for meetings. In addition, the company s employees, at all of its production sites, and in all countries in which it is located, are being made more aware of the need to think and act with an orientation to sustainability (the company is doing this, for example, by promoting alternative mobility solutions, participating in action days focused on sus- tainability, participating in sustainability-oriented workshops, and providing information about ways to reduce power and resources consumption). These efforts are being supported by employee initiatives focused on sustainability, such as the Green Team in Brazil and a sustainability program in Hungary that has over 80 green volunteers.

It is also important in light of the Group s strategic approach to climate protection and of the growing concerns and business operations, strategy expectations of our stakeholders. Consequently, we are now aiming to limit our annual energy consumption  C and have and financial planning. defined progress toward this aim as remuneration-relevant for our Board of Management. In addition, we are seeking to reduce our electricity costs. For this reason, we have launched a number of programs for improving energy efficiency at our locations and our plants. In the framework of our environmental program, we have studied our value chain in order to identify potential for enhancing resource efficiency and reducing CO emissions. In the process, a total of ten central action areas for future measures were identified that are expected to make our company s operations more sustainable overall. The measures include, for example, labelling of products that are especially sustainable.

In addition, we analyzed the impacts resulting from political, technological, and social developments tied to the transition toward a low-carbon economy that has been initiated. Further details are provided here in the CR report. b) Describe the organization s processes for addressing the The process for identifying the opportunities and risks tied to climate change comprises the following: climate-related risks. Screening of media and NGO publications Actively supporting the work of various industry associations that are studying the issue of climate change, such as GeSI, econsense, Foundation 2a, ICC, GSMA, and ETNO Initiating and participating in stakeholder dialogs on the issue of climate change Analyzing responses to the CDP img supply-chain program Analyzing relevant enquiries of rating agencies, such as RobecoSAM img, CDP, Sustainalytics, etc. The process for evaluating the opportunities and risks tied to climate change comprises the following: Identifying and quantifying the important trends Calculating the impacts on operations Analyzing the impacts on the value chain Currently, we are working to financially quantify all of the climate-related opportunities and risks involved. For some opportunities and risks, the quantification has already been completed and is being reported in the CDP questionnaire. The resulting financial impacts are then taken into account in the company s planning. Management instruments for taking account of climate protection in investment decisions are regularly reviewed for feasibility and benefit (instruments such as an internal CO2 price, for example). On an expert-knowledge basis, opportunities and risks are evaluated in terms of their potential financial impacts (on EBITDA-AL) and of the probability of their occurrence. Where opportunities and risks cannot be quantifed, their potential impacts can be reported in qualitative terms. Once risks and opportunities have been identified, they are analyzed and evaluated, in detail, in terms of the probability of their occurrence and their potential financial impacts. This can be done with the help of a scenario analysis, for example. Then we decide what concrete measures need to be taken in order to reduce the risks or exploit the opportunities. As a next step, in each case the relevant risk owner implements the measures, and monitors and evaluates their effectiveness. As necessary, the above steps are repeated and adjusted in light of the latest pertinent developments and decisions.

On a quarterly basis, risks and opportunities (with impacts of over 100 million euros on EBITDA) are identified via a Group-wide risk-management process (RMP) that has been developed, and is managed, by the Group Risk Governance department. The RMP provides methods and systems for identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities. The responsibility for reporting on Group risks and opportunities is divided among the relevant business units; consequently, GCR is responsible for climate risks. Further information on the risk process is available in our annual report. In addition, managers from our risk area took part in our internal workshop for identification of key climate-related opportunities and risks.

In various workshops with experts from the areas of technology, procurement, strategy and risk management, we defined the main climate-related opportunities and risks and began weighting them. In the process, we considered the conse- quences, for our business operations, that could result from the physical impacts of progressing climate change. In addition, we analyzed the impacts resulting from political, technological, and social developments tied to the transition toward a low-carbon economy that has been initiated. The important climate-related risks include possible network-infra- structure failures as a result of damage to secondary infrastructure (involving power failures, for example) or failures of cooling sys- tems. Another risk consists of possible network damage or failure as a result of network-infrastructure damage due to climate events or changes in climate conditions. The important climate-related opportunities we have identified include the increasing use of energy-efficient technologies (in net- work operations, for example), and growing demand for climate- friendly products and services.

The most important key figures for measuring and managing Physical risks climate-related opportunities and risks Extreme weather conditions as a consequence of climate change will have a negative impact on our business processes and will inevitably lead to incidents or even network outages. Among the effects of such breakdowns is their massive impact on the man- agement of rescue operations, for example, sometimes even rendering such emergency efforts entirely impossible. In order to be able to react appropriately in these cases, we have defined the necessary responsibilities, processes, and measures in our internal Group Policy on Continuity and Situation Management. The policy also outlines how to handle emergency and crisis situations like floods. We also take possible consequences of climate change into account when planning our future business activities. For example, our network infrastructure is set up to be better protected from storm conditions, changes in temperature, and high winds and keep mobile supply infrastructure on hand for emergencies. Financial risks Climate change also carries financial risks  C for example, from levies on CO emissions or through increases in energy costs. Our contribution to the mitigation of these risks includes measur- ing our own energy efficiency and developing measures for improvement. To prevent infrastructure failure due to extreme weather events, additional investment in a more robust infra- structure might be necessary. environment 91 Resource efficiency in operations Resource efficiency in operations Resource efficiency at the workplace Less food waste in cafeterias We also contribute to resource efficiency at the workplace: We try Since 2020, we have been offering our employees discounted to use as many green office supplies as possible.

To that end, emis- sions are converted into metric kilotons of CO equivalents (COe). We break down the emissions that occur along our value chain; this gives us an overview of where in the value chain the majority of them occur. By making a complete transition to electricity from renewable energies, we were able to considerably reduce our Scope 2 emis- sions in the year under review. In 2021, market-based Scope 1 and 2 emissions throughout the Group amounted to around 247 000 metric tons of COe, or about 90 percent lower than in the previ- ous year. In 2021, Scope 3 emissions increased in comparison to the previ- ous year  C by 13.9 million metric tons, to around 14.8 million met- ric tons of COe. Most of these emissions resulted from the manu- facture of products and components (in particular devices and network technology), and from the use of our products and ser- vices (for example, sold or rented fixed-line and mobile phones, routers, and media receivers) by our customers. We also include emissions resulting from the use of our services by our customers  own devices, such as laptops or televisions. Emissions from the manufacture and transportation of technology required for estab- lishing our networks are also taken into account. Currently, we are studying various factors that will influence the quantities of our future emissions. Complete-coverage introduc- tion of the Internet Protocol (All-IP), and our suppliers climate-pro- tection efforts, are having a positive impact. In addition, lower power mix factors, and improved energy efficiency in the devices used in connection with our products and services, can be expected to lower emissions. On the other hand, it is possible that the numbers of (new) devices used in connection with our prod- ucts and services will increase. The switch to the new mobile com- munications standard 5G, wider network coverage, and higher- quality fixed lines are also expected to result in emissions increases. ENVIRONMENT 106 CO2e emissions Total COe emissions (Scopes 1 to 3) T-Systems International In addition to discussing the emissions of the Group as a whole, we provide separate information on Scope 1 C3 emissions for T-Systems International. We present our Scope 1 C3 greenhouse- gas emissions in a consistent manner, so that they can be com- pared with each other. To that end, emissions are converted into metric kilotons of CO equivalents (COe). We also break down emissions along our value chain. This gives us an overview of where most of the emissions are produced in our value chain. In 2021, market-based Scope 1 and 2 emissions for T-Systems amounted to around 11 000 metric tons of COe. In the same year, the Scope 3 emissions were 285 000 metric tons of COe, thereby accounting for the largest emissions share. Most of these emis- sions occurred in the upstream value chain, as well in our custom- ers  use of our products and services. In those emissions, we also include emissions resulting from the use of our services by our customers  own devices, such as laptops or tablet computers. Reporting against standards Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) GRI 305-3 (Emissions) Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) The most important key figures for measuring and managing climate- related opportunities and risks ENVIRONMENT 107 CO2e emissions Total COe emissions (Scope 1 & 2 emissions) Our CO emissions are largely driven by our electricity consump- tion. That s why the table below contains very detailed information about the Group numbers for the Scope 2 emissions resulting from our electricity consumption. We differentiate between the market-based and location-based methods, thereby adhering to the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. Market- and location-based emissions are reported in CO equivalents (COe). This change was made in order to allow a transparent comparison between Scope 1 to 3 emissions and to be consistent with the requirements of the Science-Based Targets Initiative, to which the new target is also geared. The leading reporting method is the market-based approach. This method is used to calculate emissions with a specific emissions factor (provider factor) per DT company. This factor depends on a company s actual energy procurement (electricity mix); procuring renewable energy (direct purchase, certificates) reduces emissions.a) In contrast to the market-based method, with the location-based method the emissions factors for the respective country are used (the country mix factor of the International Energy Agency (IEA)). A company s actual energy procurement (electricity mix) is hence not taken into account, i.e., not even the procurement of renewable energy over and above the country mix. Change compared to the previous year: The Scope 2 emissions calculated according to the market-based method are about 90 percent lowe than in the previous year. The significant change compared to the previous year results from the Group-wide use of green electricity, PPAs and certificates. Since 2021, we have covered 100 percent of our electricity consumption throughout the Group from renewable sources, thus achieving one of our climate targets. ENVIRONMENT 108 CO2e emissions The graphic presents our Scope 3 emissions from 2019-2021, broken down by emission source. In 2021, upstream emissions accounted for about 38 percent of our Scope 3 emissions, while downstream emissions accounted for about 62 percent. The basic data used to calculate Scope 3 emissions are reported in the per- formance-indicator tool.

So far, however, this has not allowed us to prevent all CO emissions, which is why we compen- sate for those emissions by investing in certified climate protec- tion projects. Our Event Policy specifies the ways in which we offset emissions generated by events. In 2021, we offset over 18 000 metric tons of CO through various measures.

Since 2014, we have been studying the potential savings that vari- ous products can achieve on the user side; we carried out 17 such assessments in 2021. Also, we again tracked emissions reductions resulting from installation of efficient wall-mounted charging sta- tions for electric cars (wall boxes). The largest potential in Ger- many lies in the area of connected cars with 6.8 million tons of CO, followed by video conferencing with 4.5 million tons of CO. The greatest savings potential lies with cloud computing, which enables our customers to reduce their CO emissions by using our cloud services and outsourcing their existing infrastructure to our efficient data centers. Better servers, more energy-efficient data centers, and higher infrastructure capacity utilization can thus cut energy consumption and the associated emissions by up to 80 percent.

In determining the amount, the national companies can also include certificates (guarantees of origin) and power purchase agreements (PPAs) for electricity obtained from renewable energy. Deutsche Telekom in Germany purchases its electricity as part of a green tariff. 59 percent comes directly from renewable energies. The rest is covered by guarantees of origin, power purchase agree- ments (PPAs), and a small proportion by in-house generation. T-Mobile US intends to reach our Group target primarily with wind power, but with solar energy as well. To that end, the American national company has concluded long-term contracts (12-15 years) with wind and solar farm operators, which gives the power producers security of investment. Thanks to PPAs, two new wind parks in the United States were put into operation in 2021. We are also aiming to conclude such long-term electricity purchase agreements in other countries.

In May 2021, Deutsche Telekom IT RUS, with the support of its Think Green community, took part in the #GreenMagenta weeks event. At the event location, it held sev- eral workshops for its employees on the topics of sustainability and green lifestyles.

In a concerted effort, the partici- pants collected some 700 kilograms of trash and brought it to a recycling center. Magyar Telekom (Hungary) In 2019, Magyar Telekom became the first company in Hungary to launch a community solar project. As part of the project, 100 Magyar Telekom employees were able to rent a solar panel from the company for one year. As a reward for their contribution to Deutsche Telekom s climate protection activities, the donors received benefits such as an additional day off. The solar modules were installed on Magyar Telekom's training facility; the energy generated is used on site. The panels cover a quarter of the build- ing s energy consumption. The project was continued in 2021. Other national companies committed to a more sustainable corporate culture include: T-Mobile US (USA): Employees of this U.S. company have formed an online community focused on sustainability. In it, around 70 employees regularly discuss and keep up-to-date on T-Mobile s environmental initiatives. Magenta Telekom: About 25 employees of this company in Austria take part in #GreenMagenta and #GoodMagenta working groups. T-Systems Limited (UK): An interdepartmental team of eight employees reviews, discusses and promotes sustainability issues within the company. OTE Group (Greece): The Green Ambassadors, founded in 2019, are working to create a green culture, inspire OTE Group employees, collect ideas and provide information about pro- jects such as #ZEROPLASTIC and recycling programs. T-Systems do Brasil Ltda.: The T-Green Team consisting of 22 employees is committed to recycling and donation campaigns as well as to communicating ways to save energy and avoid waste both inside and outside the company. Employee communities are also active, or in the process of being established, at other national companies such as T-Mobile Czech Republic, Hrvatski Telekom (Croatia), T-Systems Mexico and DT IT Solutions Slovakia.

Along with STEM-related skills, the skills in question include critical thinking, good judgement and discernment, creativity, and communication and teamworking skills. The foundation provides such support out of the conviction that a modern education system must give young people the best possible preparation for meeting global challenges such as digital transformation, climate change, electro- mobility, and biodiversity. ESG KPIs Community Contribution, Beneficiaries  C Focus topics and Reach As part of our assessment of the impacts of our social commit- ment, we report a set of three ESG KPIs: Community Contribu- tion, Beneficiaries  C Focus topics and Reach. In using these KPIs, we rely on methods employed by the organization Business for Societal Impact (B4SI), which incorporate the aspects input, output and impact. In 2020, Deutsche Telekom s KPIs were oriented especially to the topic of media literacy. In 2021, we then turned their main focus to digital inclusion  C because that is a central aim of our CR and corporate strategy. Community Contribution To determine the overall commitment of our employees, we look The ESG KPI Community Contribution reflects activities in which at the number of hours our employees have put in under our Cor- Deutsche Telekom was involved in the community either finan- porate Volunteering program.

Our ambition in this connection: Increase the KPI Projects that promote media literacy are one focus of engage- ment@telekom. With such projects, our employees help people better understand digital phenomena, thus laying the groundwork for participation in the digital world. One example is the Group- wide initiative DIGITAL@School (known as IT@School until the end of 2021). Using age-appropriate strategies and language, the committed employees in that initiative help children in schools and other educational institutions become acquainted with STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) subjects, and they carry out workshops on programming. In addition, they teach skills that children need in order to use digital media responsibly. Environmental issues also play an important role in the framework of engagement@telekom. As part of our commitment in this area, employees active in our Green Pioneers Initiative have initi- ated efforts to help reduce our carbon footprint. These efforts con- tribute to our Group efforts in the area of sustainability. In addition, Deutsche Telekom employees again volunteered their time for the annual fundraiser Ein Herz f 1r Kinder (A heart for children) and for the SAT.1 TV channels hotline for collecting donations for victims of the July floods in Germany.

Promoting female STEM specialists With carefully targeted messaging, we are seeking to attract tal- ented women to our company. As part of this effort, we promote women in STEM subjects and professions (STEM = science, tech- nology, engineering, mathematics). In 2021, for example, we invited female students from around the world to apply for our eighth Womens STEM Award. In addition, we conducted an inno- vation workship in the framework of our partnership with Femtec. Femtec, a cooperative effort being undertaken by major compa- nies, the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, leading German technical uni- versities, and ETH Z 1rich, is aimed at finding young female talent for STEM professions and developing it. At the innovation work- shop, a group of nearly 30 scholarship holders developed, over a five-month period, a technically innovative, green solution for smart, energy-autonomous cellular base stations. In addition, we are committed to Global Digital Women, an international network of women working to increase the percentage of women in digital professions. Social 147 Diversity Percentage of women on the management board In 2020 we achieved the goal of 30 percent women in manage- ment positions. Since November 2020, a third woman has been appointed to the Board of Management. We continue to be at the top of all DAX Groups with a female share of 37.5 percent. Deutsche Telekom is one of the few DAX Groups where women have been part of the Board of Management for several years now. In addition, more and more women are working in international management teams below the Board of Management level. You can find further information in the HR Factbook.

That is why we encourage and support young people from different backgrounds and nationalities. In addition to offering a part-time training program and a part-time dual study program, we also support disadvantaged young people  C with an entry- level training internship. Also, school students who have not yet received an apprenticeship position can take part in an internship sponsored by the Federal Employment Agency, and thereby receive the opportunity to become acquainted with an occupation and prepare for regular training in it. The internships run for twelve months, and can in some cases be credited toward a follow-on training program. We also offer young refugees opportunities to take part in entry-level training, regular vocational training or a dual study program. All applicants receive the same opportunities to begin a career with Deutsche Telekom. As of December 31, 2021, 6.52 percent of the apprentices and dual students we employed were of non-German nationality; in total, 49 nations were represented. More diversity and inclusion for T-Mobile US In the fall of 2020, the Board of Directors of our national company in the United States adopted a new declaration of intent for more diversity and inclusion. The declaration of intent was also signed by six major American civil rights organizations with whom T-Mobile US plans more intensive collaboration. To that end, T-Mobile US has established a Diversity and Inclusion Council where each of the signing civil rights organizations has a seat. Other organizations are also involved with the council; a complete list is published on the T-Mobile US website. The Council, which has a total of twelve members, advises T-Mobile US with regard to diversity, equity and inclusion issues. In addition, it assists the company in defining relevant priorities and goals, and it provides support for implementation of the companys strategic diversity plan. The Council convened for the first time in 2020. As of 2021, its meetings take place on a quarterly to semiannual basis. In addition to the new council, T-Mobile US also has an internal Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) network. Participants meet to address current issues, question prejudices, and learn from each other. Tens of thousands of employees  C in total, some 36 percent of the companys workforce in the United States  C participate in the D&I network. The network includes a group for people with dis- abilities (Accessibility Community), a multicultural group (Multi- cultural Alliance), an intergenerational network (Multigenerational Network), an LGBTQI* community (Pride), a network for veterans and active military personnel (Veterans & Allies Network), and a womens network (Women & Allies Network). T-Mobile US has received a number of awards for its efforts in these areas. In 2021, for example, it received Comparablys Best Global Company Culture award and the prestigious Forbes honor Americas Best Employers for Diversity 2021.

Investments in the capital market made by Deutsche Telekom for company pension schemes and similar obligations in Germany are based on our sustainability principles. These principles were inte- grated into our socially responsible investment strategy for Deutsche Telekom pension providers, which we introduced in 2013, in the form of exclusion criteria. They prohibit investments in companies that produce NBC weapons, anti-personnel mines or cluster bombs or that trade in these or have repeatedly violated the UN Global Compact principles. Deutsche Telekom pension funds are also prohibited from purchasing government securities from governments that are subject to sanctions in accordance with public international law. Our pension providers agreed to our socially responsible investment strategy in 2013. This strategy was reviewed in 2017 and now incorporates Best-in-Class strategies and engagement approaches. We are convinced that putting this strategy into practice will help improve our financial risk indicators. This strategy will also pro- mote perception of Telekom as a socially responsible company. It will help us avoid high-risk, controversial investments and, instead, invest in long-term, stable values that are in line with our principles of sustainability.

National and international IPRs are vital for these types of activity. We are strongly dedicated to generating our own property rights. Industrial property rights include inventions, patent applications, patents, utility models and design patents. Thanks to our intense efforts to develop and structure our IPR portfolio, the rights we hold are highly valuable and firmly in line with our Group s strategic objectives. We have put in place a pro- fessional patent law management process to keep our IPR assets safe. Additionally, we are represented on various standardization bodies in our industry. We manage our IPRs on the basis of cost/ benefit aspects, filing only selected applications and de-register- ing patents systematically.

Tim Hottges, Chairman of the Board of Management of Deutsche Telekom, said:  The systematic efforts we have made for climate protection in the past two years have paid off.. This is not the time to be smug and give ourselves a pat on the back, however. The data is clear: this is a decisive decade for the global climate. We at Deutsche Telekom are actively leading by example: by 2025, we want to reduce our in-house emissions by up to 95 percent compared to 2017. We will neutralize the last five or so percent of our carbon footprint through high-value carbon capture projects. In a future-proof economy the goal must be to achieve net zero.\n","Telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom announced a significant acceleration of its climate targets today, including bringing forward its goal to be a net zero company by 10 years to 2040. The company s new climate goals include achieving net zero direct and indirect Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025. To achieve this target, the company anticipates reducing CO2 emissions by up to 95% compared to 2017 and offsetting remaining emissions, marking a major increase over its prior commitment, set in 2019, to reduce emissions by 90% by 2030. Deutsche Telekom also plans to completely eliminate its carbon footprint by 2040, achieving net zero in Scope 3 emissions ( including  value chain  categories such as goods and services acquired, capital goods, use of sold products, rented or leased equipment), where over 80% of emissions originate.

Birgit Klesper, Senior Vice President of Group Corporate Responsibility, said:  The Scope 3 emissions are certainly the most difficult part of our journey to net zero. These difficulties can t be used as an excuse, however. We need to use them as motivation. As a large corporation, we work purposefully together with our suppliers as partners to systematically reduce the emissions which impact on the climate. In this respect we also have achieving net zero by 2040 as a clear goal ahead of us.  The company stated that in order to achieve net zero, reductions in emissions need to be combined with a strategy to neutralize the CO2 emissions which can not yet be avoided. Deutsche Telekom is focusing on carbon removal measures in which CO2 is actively captured from the atmosphere, including planting trees to capture CO2 or even rewilding projects for bogs.

The world is facing massive threats to biodiversity and nature. To remain on track to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, we must reduce emissions significantly before 2030. Many policymakers continue to drag their feet, voicing concerns that climate action will burden businesses. However, many top business leaders are increasingly putting their companies on a more sustainability-minded course. The vast majority of them have accepted the findings of climate science and moved beyond the phase of denial and hesitation.
